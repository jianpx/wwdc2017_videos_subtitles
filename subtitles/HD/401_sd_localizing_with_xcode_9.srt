[ Applause ]


3
00:00:22,046 --> 00:00:22,666
>> Good morning, everyone.


4
00:00:23,746 --> 00:00:24,756
Sorry about the technical


5
00:00:24,756 --> 00:00:26,656
difficulties, but we're ready.


6
00:00:26,886 --> 00:00:28,156
[laughing] All right, so I'm


7
00:00:28,156 --> 00:00:29,476
Sarah Roddy and welcome to


8
00:00:29,476 --> 00:00:31,506
Localizing with Xcode 9 session.


9
00:00:31,506 --> 00:00:32,926
And today, with my colleagues Ia


10
00:00:33,006 --> 00:00:34,236
and Chris, who would like to


11
00:00:34,236 --> 00:00:35,806
talk to you about some exciting


12
00:00:36,056 --> 00:00:37,266
new improvements we made to the


13
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:39,456
localization process in Xcode 9.


14
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:40,906
So let's get started.


15
00:00:43,696 --> 00:00:45,786
Around the world, you have so


16
00:00:45,786 --> 00:00:47,506
many people who are looking to


17
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,126
access and use your great


18
00:00:49,126 --> 00:00:51,206
applications, but they can't do


19
00:00:51,206 --> 00:00:52,586
that if you don't give them the


20
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,526
ability to use your apps in


21
00:00:54,526 --> 00:00:55,486
their native language.


22
00:00:57,286 --> 00:00:59,206
And your app can easily access


23
00:00:59,206 --> 00:01:00,826
this global audience by


24
00:01:00,826 --> 00:01:02,516
following some simple steps and


25
00:01:02,516 --> 00:01:03,336
best practices.


26
00:01:03,616 --> 00:01:05,355
And, in today's session, we will


27
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:07,666
talk about how Xcode makes it so


28
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:09,246
easy for you to add new


29
00:01:09,246 --> 00:01:11,476
languages to make your app look


30
00:01:11,726 --> 00:01:13,376
and feel local, which will allow


31
00:01:13,376 --> 00:01:14,236
you to go global.


32
00:01:15,196 --> 00:01:17,146
So there are three main topics


33
00:01:17,146 --> 00:01:18,316
we will be covering today.


34
00:01:18,956 --> 00:01:20,726
First, we will start with how to


35
00:01:20,726 --> 00:01:23,806
make your code world ready, then


36
00:01:23,806 --> 00:01:24,726
we will walk you through the


37
00:01:24,726 --> 00:01:26,396
localization process in Xcode


38
00:01:26,396 --> 00:01:28,356
and introduce new features we


39
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:29,556
added in Xcode 9.


40
00:01:30,956 --> 00:01:32,006
Finally, and through the


41
00:01:32,006 --> 00:01:33,806
presentation, we will talk about


42
00:01:33,866 --> 00:01:35,436
testing and give you some best


43
00:01:35,436 --> 00:01:37,116
practices to make sure that your


44
00:01:37,116 --> 00:01:39,426
app works and looks great in all


45
00:01:39,426 --> 00:01:40,656
languages that you support.


46
00:01:40,926 --> 00:01:43,036
So let's start with


47
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:43,856
internationalization.


48
00:01:48,046 --> 00:01:49,666
So internationalization is the


49
00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:51,296
process of designing your


50
00:01:51,296 --> 00:01:53,436
software so it can be adapted to


51
00:01:53,436 --> 00:01:55,496
different languages and regions


52
00:01:55,806 --> 00:01:57,346
without making code changes


53
00:01:57,346 --> 00:01:59,336
every single time you are adding


54
00:01:59,336 --> 00:02:00,926
a new language to your app.


55
00:02:01,676 --> 00:02:02,936
So the point here is it


56
00:02:02,936 --> 00:02:04,836
shouldn't matter which language


57
00:02:04,936 --> 00:02:06,256
your app is running in.


58
00:02:06,796 --> 00:02:08,295
If the language has short text


59
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:12,196
or long text or tall text or


60
00:02:12,196 --> 00:02:14,336
even text or layout that flows


61
00:02:14,336 --> 00:02:16,326
from right to left, your app


62
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,526
should be able to adapt


63
00:02:17,526 --> 00:02:19,046
dynamically to all these


64
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:19,686
scenarios.


65
00:02:20,196 --> 00:02:22,996
And the first step in


66
00:02:22,996 --> 00:02:25,456
internationalization is managing


67
00:02:25,456 --> 00:02:26,116
your strings.


68
00:02:26,786 --> 00:02:30,006
Your app will be localized by


69
00:02:30,006 --> 00:02:32,036
translators who would be working


70
00:02:32,036 --> 00:02:34,376
with your strings and in this


71
00:02:34,376 --> 00:02:35,696
localized string is there to


72
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:37,776
make it easier for you to create


73
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:39,706
localizable content for your


74
00:02:39,706 --> 00:02:41,186
translators as well as


75
00:02:41,226 --> 00:02:42,716
displaying the right text at the


76
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,316
right time.


77
00:02:44,116 --> 00:02:45,796
So if your strings are coming


78
00:02:45,796 --> 00:02:47,606
from a storyboard or a zip file


79
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:49,376
they're localizable by default,


80
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:50,536
so we don't need to worry about


81
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:50,766
those.


82
00:02:51,226 --> 00:02:52,596
But sometimes you might have


83
00:02:52,646 --> 00:02:54,426
some strings that are defined in


84
00:02:54,426 --> 00:02:55,856
your source code that will be


85
00:02:55,856 --> 00:02:57,226
displayed to the user, like


86
00:02:57,226 --> 00:02:59,336
error messages or notifications;


87
00:02:59,336 --> 00:03:00,606
if you would like to notify your


88
00:03:00,606 --> 00:03:01,656
users about something.


89
00:03:02,036 --> 00:03:03,296
And you want to make sure that


90
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,496
this translator is also


91
00:03:04,496 --> 00:03:05,146
localizable.


92
00:03:05,716 --> 00:03:07,106
And to do that you just need to


93
00:03:07,106 --> 00:03:08,796
wrap those strings with NS


94
00:03:08,876 --> 00:03:09,716
Localized String.


95
00:03:10,786 --> 00:03:12,826
In addition to that you can use


96
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:14,886
NS Localized String as a format


97
00:03:15,046 --> 00:03:17,196
string with localized language


98
00:03:17,246 --> 00:03:19,116
format to get a localized and a


99
00:03:19,196 --> 00:03:20,076
formatted string.


100
00:03:21,146 --> 00:03:22,386
So here let's go through a quick


101
00:03:22,386 --> 00:03:23,276
example together.


102
00:03:24,276 --> 00:03:25,796
So here they have a label.


103
00:03:26,176 --> 00:03:27,796
When I set its text to a string


104
00:03:27,826 --> 00:03:28,806
called population.


105
00:03:29,196 --> 00:03:30,976
So again, my string is hardcoded


106
00:03:30,976 --> 00:03:32,436
and is not localizable.


107
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:34,966
To make it localizable, you just


108
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:36,516
need to wrap it with NS


109
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:37,306
Localized String.


110
00:03:37,616 --> 00:03:38,836
And as you can see here on the


111
00:03:38,836 --> 00:03:40,596
screen, NS Localized String


112
00:03:40,646 --> 00:03:43,016
takes two arguments, your string


113
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:43,766
and a comment.


114
00:03:44,376 --> 00:03:45,976
Comments here are really, really


115
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,156
important to provide to your


116
00:03:47,156 --> 00:03:49,086
translators so they have context


117
00:03:49,086 --> 00:03:50,296
about the string they are


118
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:51,006
translating.


119
00:03:51,746 --> 00:03:54,106
And I would say most of the time


120
00:03:54,106 --> 00:03:55,446
you just need to use NS


121
00:03:55,516 --> 00:03:57,666
Localized String, but in some


122
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,086
cases when you're working on a


123
00:03:59,086 --> 00:04:00,826
framework or a shared component


124
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:02,636
you might want to use NS


125
00:04:02,636 --> 00:04:04,156
Localized String from table


126
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:06,146
where you specify the table name


127
00:04:06,286 --> 00:04:07,406
where your strings are coming


128
00:04:07,406 --> 00:04:07,796
from.


129
00:04:08,326 --> 00:04:11,526
And as I mentioned before, you


130
00:04:11,526 --> 00:04:13,426
can also combine NS Localized


131
00:04:13,426 --> 00:04:14,456
String with Localized String


132
00:04:14,456 --> 00:04:17,176
with Format, where NS Localized


133
00:04:17,176 --> 00:04:18,305
String is a format string.


134
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:19,906
And in this case it's really,


135
00:04:19,906 --> 00:04:21,276
really critical that you provide


136
00:04:21,276 --> 00:04:22,306
those comments for your


137
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:24,346
translators so they have context


138
00:04:24,346 --> 00:04:25,626
about the string they are


139
00:04:25,656 --> 00:04:26,266
translating.


140
00:04:27,336 --> 00:04:30,946
Then at run time NS Localized


141
00:04:30,946 --> 00:04:32,116
String will determine the


142
00:04:32,176 --> 00:04:34,196
preferred language of the user


143
00:04:34,686 --> 00:04:36,596
and find the corresponding


144
00:04:36,596 --> 00:04:38,046
localizable string files.


145
00:04:38,506 --> 00:04:39,876
As you can see here, this is an


146
00:04:39,876 --> 00:04:41,986
example of a localizable string


147
00:04:41,986 --> 00:04:43,796
files coming from the French


148
00:04:43,796 --> 00:04:45,756
localization projects and it


149
00:04:45,756 --> 00:04:47,306
contains all your localizable


150
00:04:47,306 --> 00:04:48,266
strings, the one that you


151
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:49,976
wrapped with NS Localized String


152
00:04:50,226 --> 00:04:51,486
as well as the comments that you


153
00:04:51,486 --> 00:04:51,896
provided.


154
00:04:51,896 --> 00:04:53,896
And this is the information that


155
00:04:53,896 --> 00:04:54,586
will be provided to your


156
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:54,976
translator.


157
00:04:59,116 --> 00:05:00,196
And if you're using Objective


158
00:05:00,196 --> 00:05:01,936
Senior App you can run the


159
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:03,736
static analyzer to find


160
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,276
localizability problems in your


161
00:05:05,276 --> 00:05:07,796
code, like if you forgot to make


162
00:05:07,796 --> 00:05:09,516
a string localizable or if you


163
00:05:09,516 --> 00:05:10,806
forgot to add a comment to a


164
00:05:10,806 --> 00:05:13,356
localizable string you can run


165
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:14,776
the static analyzer and you get


166
00:05:14,776 --> 00:05:16,526
warnings that will show you what


167
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:17,966
these problems are and you can


168
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:19,146
fix them right on your code.


169
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,786
If you'd like to learn more


170
00:05:20,786 --> 00:05:22,366
about the static analyzer please


171
00:05:22,396 --> 00:05:23,886
check out this talk from last


172
00:05:23,886 --> 00:05:23,976
year.


173
00:05:28,126 --> 00:05:29,506
Another thing that your app


174
00:05:29,506 --> 00:05:31,036
should handle well when it comes


175
00:05:31,096 --> 00:05:33,126
to localization is working with


176
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:35,056
different visual representations


177
00:05:35,056 --> 00:05:37,566
of date, time, numbers, et


178
00:05:37,566 --> 00:05:38,006
cetera.


179
00:05:38,926 --> 00:05:41,596
For example, 12-hour time format


180
00:05:41,746 --> 00:05:43,716
is a standard format we use here


181
00:05:43,716 --> 00:05:45,466
in the US, but you want to make


182
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:47,556
sure that a user who's using


183
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,586
your app in France, for example,


184
00:05:49,876 --> 00:05:51,316
is getting 24-hour time


185
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:52,686
formatting set because this is


186
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:53,916
the default format used there.


187
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:58,036
And we provide a variety of very


188
00:05:58,086 --> 00:05:59,456
powerful formatters that will


189
00:05:59,456 --> 00:06:01,166
let you handle the complexity of


190
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,566
data formatting and regions, but


191
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:04,826
just to give you an example on


192
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:06,466
how formatters work, let's take


193
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,726
a look at a date formatter


194
00:06:07,726 --> 00:06:07,966
example.


195
00:06:12,046 --> 00:06:13,346
So here let's say you want to


196
00:06:13,346 --> 00:06:15,446
display a full date format in


197
00:06:15,446 --> 00:06:16,426
your app.


198
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:20,136
So instead of setting a date


199
00:06:20,136 --> 00:06:21,776
format string that is specific


200
00:06:21,836 --> 00:06:23,766
to a region or a country that


201
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:25,746
has a specific order, we


202
00:06:25,746 --> 00:06:27,566
recommend that you use date


203
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:27,986
style.


204
00:06:29,136 --> 00:06:30,396
This formatter has different


205
00:06:30,396 --> 00:06:31,956
styles that you can choose from,


206
00:06:33,236 --> 00:06:34,296
but since here we want to


207
00:06:34,296 --> 00:06:35,896
display a full date format I'm


208
00:06:35,956 --> 00:06:37,306
setting my date style to full.


209
00:06:37,686 --> 00:06:39,066
So with that you are making sure


210
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,486
that your date is formatted


211
00:06:40,546 --> 00:06:42,686
correctly in all regions in the


212
00:06:42,686 --> 00:06:42,986
world.


213
00:06:43,496 --> 00:06:45,956
As you can see on the screen,


214
00:06:45,956 --> 00:06:47,226
there are differences between


215
00:06:47,226 --> 00:06:48,806
the date format in the US and


216
00:06:48,806 --> 00:06:50,136
the date format in France, like


217
00:06:50,136 --> 00:06:51,356
the French date does not have


218
00:06:51,356 --> 00:06:53,076
any commas, the month name is


219
00:06:53,076 --> 00:06:54,876
not capitalized, the day of the


220
00:06:54,876 --> 00:06:56,056
month comes before the month


221
00:06:56,056 --> 00:06:57,526
itself, and this would not be


222
00:06:57,526 --> 00:07:00,006
achievable if you have pasted in


223
00:07:00,316 --> 00:07:01,856
a date format instead of a date


224
00:07:01,856 --> 00:07:01,976
style.


225
00:07:05,106 --> 00:07:06,736
In addition to date formatter,


226
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,006
we have a series of formatters


227
00:07:09,176 --> 00:07:10,976
for common data types available


228
00:07:10,976 --> 00:07:11,776
in foundation.


229
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:13,226
If you'd like to learn more


230
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:14,576
about formatters please check


231
00:07:14,576 --> 00:07:15,626
out these two great talks from


232
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:15,896
last year.


233
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,236
Finally, you want to make sure


234
00:07:22,236 --> 00:07:23,656
that your user interface is


235
00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:25,476
flexible and looks nice and


236
00:07:25,476 --> 00:07:26,986
beautiful in all languages that


237
00:07:26,986 --> 00:07:30,166
you support and to do that the


238
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,426
process is really simple.


239
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:33,166
We just need to use base


240
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,176
internationalization and auto


241
00:07:35,176 --> 00:07:35,506
layout.


242
00:07:36,186 --> 00:07:37,486
So let's talk about base


243
00:07:37,486 --> 00:07:38,656
internationalization for a


244
00:07:38,656 --> 00:07:39,086
moment.


245
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:42,196
So by enabling base


246
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:43,486
internationalization in your


247
00:07:43,576 --> 00:07:46,066
project, Xcode modifies your


248
00:07:46,136 --> 00:07:47,996
projects for Destructor and


249
00:07:47,996 --> 00:07:50,286
separates your UI from your


250
00:07:50,286 --> 00:07:53,126
strings, which means any file


251
00:07:53,126 --> 00:07:54,526
that is related to your user


252
00:07:54,526 --> 00:07:56,816
interface, like a zip file or a


253
00:07:56,896 --> 00:07:59,016
storyboard file, will be stored


254
00:07:59,116 --> 00:07:59,596
in base [inaudible].


255
00:07:59,596 --> 00:08:03,376
While your strings, either if


256
00:08:03,376 --> 00:08:04,176
they are coming from a


257
00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:06,846
storyboard file or if they are


258
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:07,976
in your code that you wrapped


259
00:08:07,976 --> 00:08:09,516
with NS Localized String, they


260
00:08:09,516 --> 00:08:11,316
will be stored in the specific


261
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:14,426
language folders so that way you


262
00:08:14,426 --> 00:08:15,976
only have one set of user


263
00:08:15,976 --> 00:08:18,146
interface instead of duplicating


264
00:08:18,146 --> 00:08:19,566
your UI every single time you


265
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,056
are creating a new language in


266
00:08:21,846 --> 00:08:22,946
your app.


267
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:25,356
And base internationalization is


268
00:08:25,356 --> 00:08:27,306
enabled by default since Xcode


269
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:27,666
5.


270
00:08:27,746 --> 00:08:29,166
So if you have an older project


271
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,216
that you want to localize,


272
00:08:30,546 --> 00:08:31,806
please make sure that you enable


273
00:08:31,806 --> 00:08:31,976
it there.


274
00:08:36,046 --> 00:08:36,956
And you might be already


275
00:08:36,956 --> 00:08:38,866
familiar with auto layout or


276
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:39,966
you're already using it to


277
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:42,056
support different presentations


278
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:43,576
of your app or different screen


279
00:08:43,576 --> 00:08:45,896
sizes, but auto layout is also a


280
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:48,296
critical technology to use for


281
00:08:48,296 --> 00:08:49,076
localization.


282
00:08:49,756 --> 00:08:51,356
So by using auto layout you are


283
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:52,806
making sure that your app is


284
00:08:52,876 --> 00:08:54,576
flexible and it can adapt to


285
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,696
different string lengths and


286
00:08:55,696 --> 00:08:57,186
different configurations of your


287
00:08:57,736 --> 00:08:57,806
app.


288
00:08:58,856 --> 00:09:00,866
And new in Xcode 9 we are


289
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:02,626
introducing new interface


290
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,476
builder localization warnings to


291
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:06,106
validate your constraints for


292
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:08,296
localization, which means when


293
00:09:08,296 --> 00:09:10,186
you are working on your UI and


294
00:09:10,186 --> 00:09:11,626
your storyboard file or your zip


295
00:09:11,626 --> 00:09:12,816
file and you're setting up these


296
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:14,346
constraints and they are not


297
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,046
localization friendly you will


298
00:09:16,046 --> 00:09:17,576
get this warning as well as


299
00:09:17,616 --> 00:09:19,336
suggestions on how to fix them.


300
00:09:20,396 --> 00:09:21,556
And new interface builder


301
00:09:21,556 --> 00:09:23,336
warnings will be available in


302
00:09:23,336 --> 00:09:24,176
the future seat.


303
00:09:26,676 --> 00:09:28,726
Additionally we are introducing


304
00:09:28,726 --> 00:09:30,166
an Xcode -- 9 used to the


305
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,376
localization options for you to


306
00:09:32,376 --> 00:09:33,576
simulate a localized


307
00:09:33,576 --> 00:09:34,156
environment.


308
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:36,466
So instead of having a real


309
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:38,336
strings, translated strings, to


310
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:39,836
see how they look like in your


311
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,196
app you can just use one of


312
00:09:41,196 --> 00:09:42,766
these pseudo localization


313
00:09:42,766 --> 00:09:44,196
options that we are providing.


314
00:09:44,526 --> 00:09:45,896
So, in Xcode 9, we have new


315
00:09:45,896 --> 00:09:47,346
options for accented Latin


316
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,366
strings for a fixed strings and


317
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:50,596
new options for right to left


318
00:09:50,596 --> 00:09:51,076
languages.


319
00:09:51,126 --> 00:09:53,786
And with that I would like to


320
00:09:53,786 --> 00:09:56,236
call Ia on stage to give you a


321
00:09:56,236 --> 00:09:57,776
demo about how to prepare your


322
00:09:57,856 --> 00:09:58,846
app for localization.


323
00:09:59,116 --> 00:09:59,496
Thank you.


324
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:06,500
[ Applause ]


325
00:10:07,096 --> 00:10:07,976
>> Thank you, Sarah.


326
00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:15,576
Hi. I'm Ia and today I want to


327
00:10:15,576 --> 00:10:17,136
show you this really cool app


328
00:10:17,136 --> 00:10:18,266
I've been working on called


329
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:19,446
International Effects.


330
00:10:20,026 --> 00:10:21,596
As you see on the screen, my UI


331
00:10:21,596 --> 00:10:23,076
consists mostly of this table


332
00:10:23,076 --> 00:10:25,146
view and a user can go and


333
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:26,946
select a country or territory


334
00:10:26,946 --> 00:10:28,906
from this list and they'll see


335
00:10:28,906 --> 00:10:30,126
some information about it like


336
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:32,776
the flag, the population, and


337
00:10:32,776 --> 00:10:34,116
even the language population.


338
00:10:35,566 --> 00:10:36,946
So I made sure my app looks


339
00:10:37,046 --> 00:10:38,386
beautiful in English and I'm


340
00:10:38,386 --> 00:10:40,366
happy with the way it looks, but


341
00:10:40,646 --> 00:10:42,466
now I want to internationalize


342
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:43,876
it so it can be ready for my


343
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:44,966
first localization.


344
00:10:45,676 --> 00:10:46,856
And to do that I'm going to


345
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:48,576
follow the steps that Sarah just


346
00:10:48,576 --> 00:10:49,906
showed us in her slides.


347
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:51,936
So the first thing I want to do


348
00:10:51,936 --> 00:10:53,306
is my strings management.


349
00:10:54,096 --> 00:10:56,016
I'm loading all of these strings


350
00:10:56,016 --> 00:10:57,646
in my table cells in code.


351
00:10:57,646 --> 00:10:59,576
So I'm going to open my Xcode


352
00:10:59,576 --> 00:10:59,976
project.


353
00:11:06,546 --> 00:11:08,626
And in my table view controller,


354
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:10,646
in my cell for wrote indexpath


355
00:11:10,646 --> 00:11:12,586
function I want to make sure I


356
00:11:12,586 --> 00:11:14,366
don't have any hardcoded strings


357
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:16,406
that I'm loading into my UI.


358
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:18,266
And instead I want to replace


359
00:11:18,266 --> 00:11:20,586
them with a call to NS Localized


360
00:11:20,586 --> 00:11:20,866
String.


361
00:11:21,606 --> 00:11:22,766
And I'll pass in my English


362
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,396
string and I'll also give a


363
00:11:24,396 --> 00:11:25,206
helpful comment.


364
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:27,766
So; "Label preceding the


365
00:11:27,766 --> 00:11:29,466
selected territory."


366
00:11:29,796 --> 00:11:32,326
And then I also went ahead and


367
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:33,596
made sure I'm calling NS


368
00:11:33,646 --> 00:11:35,336
Localized String for all the


369
00:11:35,336 --> 00:11:36,656
other text I'm loading in code.


370
00:11:37,746 --> 00:11:39,586
So the next thing I want to do


371
00:11:39,586 --> 00:11:41,666
is I also want to make sure I'm


372
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,236
displaying and representing data


373
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,646
correctly for different locales.


374
00:11:45,476 --> 00:11:48,406
So in this case my data are


375
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:50,086
mostly these numbers that you're


376
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:51,076
seeing on the right side.


377
00:11:51,646 --> 00:11:52,956
And numbers are displayed


378
00:11:52,956 --> 00:11:53,966
differently in different


379
00:11:53,966 --> 00:11:54,416
countries.


380
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:57,176
So to format them correctly I'm


381
00:11:57,326 --> 00:11:59,086
going to use a number formatter.


382
00:12:00,526 --> 00:12:02,676
Number formatter is similar to


383
00:12:03,596 --> 00:12:04,976
date formatter that Sarah showed


384
00:12:04,976 --> 00:12:06,716
us earlier, except, of course,


385
00:12:06,756 --> 00:12:08,566
it's used to format numbers


386
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:09,306
instead of dates.


387
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,316
So for population I can simply


388
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:13,976
set my formatter's number style


389
00:12:13,976 --> 00:12:16,066
to decimal and I set "uses


390
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:17,396
grouping separator" to "true,"


391
00:12:17,896 --> 00:12:19,426
which makes it easier to read by


392
00:12:19,426 --> 00:12:20,636
separating the number by the


393
00:12:20,636 --> 00:12:21,906
thousands, and that's because


394
00:12:21,936 --> 00:12:23,406
population tends to be a large


395
00:12:23,446 --> 00:12:24,000
number.


396
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:30,246
For GDP I can also use a number


397
00:12:30,246 --> 00:12:31,996
formatter, except this time I


398
00:12:31,996 --> 00:12:33,196
would set the number style to


399
00:12:33,196 --> 00:12:35,396
currency and the currency code


400
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:36,896
to US dollars because our data


401
00:12:36,896 --> 00:12:38,286
is in US dollars.


402
00:12:38,876 --> 00:12:41,936
And finally, for the literacy


403
00:12:41,936 --> 00:12:43,666
percentage cell, as well as my


404
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,696
language population, I set the


405
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:48,636
number style to percent and I


406
00:12:48,906 --> 00:12:50,446
give it a maximum and minimum


407
00:12:50,446 --> 00:12:51,896
fraction digits to make sure it


408
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:52,646
looks consistent.


409
00:12:54,216 --> 00:12:55,266
So now that my strings are


410
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:57,206
localizable and I'm displaying


411
00:12:57,206 --> 00:12:58,816
my numbers -- and I'm formatting


412
00:12:58,816 --> 00:13:00,726
my numbers correctly, the next


413
00:13:00,726 --> 00:13:02,156
thing I want to do is make sure


414
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,966
my user interface is also ready.


415
00:13:04,856 --> 00:13:07,516
And to do that I'm going to open


416
00:13:07,516 --> 00:13:10,226
my main storyboard and I want to


417
00:13:10,226 --> 00:13:12,526
show you how you can use pseudo


418
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:14,316
languages in Interface Builder


419
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:17,276
Preview to test your app for


420
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:18,396
localization.


421
00:13:19,236 --> 00:13:20,986
So first I'll click on the top


422
00:13:20,986 --> 00:13:22,766
right corner on the Assistant


423
00:13:22,766 --> 00:13:23,876
Editor icon.


424
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:26,536
And then under this dropdown I


425
00:13:26,536 --> 00:13:28,136
want to choose "preview" and


426
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:30,326
basically it's showing me a


427
00:13:30,326 --> 00:13:31,716
preview of my storyboard.


428
00:13:32,856 --> 00:13:34,336
And on the bottom, right corner


429
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,436
I get a language chooser and if


430
00:13:38,436 --> 00:13:39,756
I had any localizations on my


431
00:13:39,756 --> 00:13:41,836
project I would see those here,


432
00:13:42,216 --> 00:13:43,996
but in this case it's showing me


433
00:13:44,426 --> 00:13:46,226
all the pseudo language options


434
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:47,346
I can use in the preview.


435
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,516
So new in Xcode 9 we've


436
00:13:49,516 --> 00:13:50,846
introduced a fixed pseudo


437
00:13:50,846 --> 00:13:51,226
language.


438
00:13:51,226 --> 00:13:52,486
So I'm going to select that to


439
00:13:52,486 --> 00:13:53,146
see what it does.


440
00:13:54,326 --> 00:13:55,806
As you can see it simply added


441
00:13:55,806 --> 00:13:57,226
those square brackets and the


442
00:13:57,226 --> 00:13:58,776
pound symbol before and after


443
00:13:58,776 --> 00:13:59,446
each string.


444
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,166
And that makes it really easy to


445
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,736
spot if something is clipping or


446
00:14:03,736 --> 00:14:05,326
not fitting in my UI because


447
00:14:05,566 --> 00:14:06,706
those symbols would be missing.


448
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:08,706
So in this case it looks like my


449
00:14:08,706 --> 00:14:10,006
button on the bottom doesn't


450
00:14:10,006 --> 00:14:11,316
have the pound symbol and that's


451
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:12,856
the first thing I saw, but if


452
00:14:12,856 --> 00:14:14,096
you take a closer look, even --


453
00:14:14,096 --> 00:14:15,646
the y is clipping in "play."


454
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,436
So I'm going to go back to my


455
00:14:17,436 --> 00:14:19,746
storyboard and see why that is.


456
00:14:21,156 --> 00:14:22,606
And it looks like I have a fixed


457
00:14:22,606 --> 00:14:24,196
width constraint, which in this


458
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,656
case is not necessary and


459
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,916
generally fixed width


460
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,936
constraints on text controls are


461
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,636
a bad idea for localization.


462
00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:34,846
So if I get rid of it you'll see


463
00:14:34,846 --> 00:14:36,466
that my pseudo language looks


464
00:14:36,466 --> 00:14:38,966
exactly as expected and now I


465
00:14:39,636 --> 00:14:41,296
know that I'm not going to be


466
00:14:41,296 --> 00:14:42,000
clipping anything.


467
00:14:43,236 --> 00:14:45,556
So these interface builder


468
00:14:45,556 --> 00:14:47,186
previews are even more helpful


469
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,406
if you have more of your UI


470
00:14:48,406 --> 00:14:49,756
defined in your storyboard.


471
00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:52,436
In my case, a lot of my UI is


472
00:14:52,436 --> 00:14:53,616
loaded in my table view


473
00:14:53,616 --> 00:14:54,166
controller.


474
00:14:54,776 --> 00:14:56,466
So I also want to show how I can


475
00:14:56,466 --> 00:14:58,286
use pseudo languages at runtime


476
00:14:58,286 --> 00:14:58,906
to test that.


477
00:15:00,716 --> 00:15:02,526
So if I select -- if I click on


478
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,466
my scheme and select "edit


479
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:06,466
scheme" -- and make sure you


480
00:15:06,466 --> 00:15:07,516
have "run" selected in the


481
00:15:07,516 --> 00:15:09,856
sidebar -- under "application


482
00:15:09,856 --> 00:15:10,946
language" you get a list of


483
00:15:10,946 --> 00:15:12,206
languages you can choose from,


484
00:15:12,776 --> 00:15:14,126
but over at the bottom you have


485
00:15:14,126 --> 00:15:15,896
a list of all the available


486
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:17,596
pseudo languages you can use as


487
00:15:17,596 --> 00:15:18,616
well -- at runtime.


488
00:15:19,676 --> 00:15:20,796
Another pseudo language we've


489
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:22,826
added in Xcode 9 is the accented


490
00:15:22,826 --> 00:15:23,656
Latin pseudo language.


491
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:24,976
And if I go ahead and play that


492
00:15:25,476 --> 00:15:33,726
--


493
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:36,926
My app will launch with accents


494
00:15:36,926 --> 00:15:38,556
above and below each of my


495
00:15:38,556 --> 00:15:39,646
localizable strings.


496
00:15:40,296 --> 00:15:41,806
And what this really helps with


497
00:15:41,806 --> 00:15:43,446
is it gives me a preview of what


498
00:15:43,446 --> 00:15:44,956
my app -- how my app would


499
00:15:44,956 --> 00:15:46,476
handle languages that use a lot


500
00:15:46,476 --> 00:15:49,286
of accents, diacritics, or even


501
00:15:49,286 --> 00:15:51,096
languages where the scripted


502
00:15:51,096 --> 00:15:52,796
self is generally taller than


503
00:15:52,796 --> 00:15:53,966
English -- like Thai for


504
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:54,396
example.


505
00:15:55,096 --> 00:15:56,786
So I can quickly scan this and


506
00:15:56,786 --> 00:15:58,286
make sure that everything's


507
00:15:58,326 --> 00:16:00,056
fitting vertically and I'm not


508
00:16:00,056 --> 00:16:02,926
seeing any clippings.


509
00:16:02,966 --> 00:16:05,316
And everything looks good here.


510
00:16:05,386 --> 00:16:08,936
And then finally one more pseudo


511
00:16:09,046 --> 00:16:10,736
language I'd like to show you at


512
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,666
runtime is the new right to left


513
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:14,856
pseudo language with right to


514
00:16:14,856 --> 00:16:15,476
left strings.


515
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:18,416
And this pseudo language is very


516
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,726
helpful in testing whether your


517
00:16:19,726 --> 00:16:21,866
app is ready for right to left


518
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:23,616
languages like Arabic and Hebrew


519
00:16:23,956 --> 00:16:25,316
where the text itself is written


520
00:16:25,316 --> 00:16:26,076
from right to left.


521
00:16:26,656 --> 00:16:28,096
So as you can see, my UI


522
00:16:28,096 --> 00:16:29,866
controls are already adjusted


523
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:32,406
and mirrored to look the way


524
00:16:32,406 --> 00:16:34,366
they would look in a right to


525
00:16:34,366 --> 00:16:35,326
left localization.


526
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,606
And what we also do is we


527
00:16:37,606 --> 00:16:39,406
display the localizable strings


528
00:16:39,406 --> 00:16:40,176
from right to left.


529
00:16:40,176 --> 00:16:41,946
So the letters themselves have


530
00:16:41,946 --> 00:16:43,816
flipped order and that really


531
00:16:43,816 --> 00:16:46,466
helps give you an idea -- or put


532
00:16:46,466 --> 00:16:47,836
you in the mindset of somebody


533
00:16:47,836 --> 00:16:49,616
who reads their text from right


534
00:16:49,616 --> 00:16:50,526
to left.


535
00:16:51,056 --> 00:16:52,806
So these are some of the pseudo


536
00:16:52,806 --> 00:16:53,996
languages.


537
00:16:54,516 --> 00:16:55,886
I highly encourage you to try


538
00:16:55,886 --> 00:16:56,336
them all.


539
00:16:56,506 --> 00:16:57,946
They're very helpful to test


540
00:16:57,946 --> 00:16:59,426
your app before you even add


541
00:16:59,426 --> 00:16:59,976
localization.


542
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:04,445
And to summarize the


543
00:17:04,445 --> 00:17:06,006
internationalization process;


544
00:17:06,866 --> 00:17:08,596
first make sure you're using


545
00:17:08,596 --> 00:17:10,076
standard APIs to load


546
00:17:10,076 --> 00:17:11,915
localizable strings as well as


547
00:17:11,955 --> 00:17:13,726
to format your data, like dates


548
00:17:13,726 --> 00:17:14,185
and numbers.


549
00:17:14,836 --> 00:17:18,435
And make sure your app is using


550
00:17:18,435 --> 00:17:20,106
base internationalization to


551
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:21,866
separate your UI from your


552
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:23,126
localizable content.


553
00:17:23,516 --> 00:17:25,136
And, of course, use auto layout


554
00:17:25,136 --> 00:17:26,526
in your UI to make sure that the


555
00:17:26,526 --> 00:17:28,846
app itself is flexible and can


556
00:17:28,876 --> 00:17:31,156
adapt to different translations.


557
00:17:32,496 --> 00:17:34,176
And, finally, we showed a lot of


558
00:17:34,256 --> 00:17:35,706
tools that can validate your


559
00:17:35,706 --> 00:17:38,016
internationalization, like the


560
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,656
new pseudo languages we've added


561
00:17:39,656 --> 00:17:41,646
and the auto layout warnings


562
00:17:41,676 --> 00:17:42,816
that are coming soon in the


563
00:17:42,816 --> 00:17:43,536
future seat.


564
00:17:44,556 --> 00:17:46,746
So my app is internationalized


565
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:48,386
now and I'm ready to add my


566
00:17:48,386 --> 00:17:49,426
first localization.


567
00:17:49,426 --> 00:17:51,286
So I'm going to call Sarah back


568
00:17:51,286 --> 00:17:53,036
up on stage to show us how to do


569
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:54,366
that since she's the expert on


570
00:17:54,596 --> 00:17:55,506
the topic.


571
00:17:56,516 --> 00:18:01,500
[ Applause ]


572
00:18:02,046 --> 00:18:03,336
>> Thank you, Ia.


573
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:04,746
So now that you're done with the


574
00:18:04,746 --> 00:18:06,276
steps that Ia showed us earlier


575
00:18:06,276 --> 00:18:07,836
in her demo, you are ready to


576
00:18:07,976 --> 00:18:09,956
add new languages to your app.


577
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:11,466
And you can do that right from


578
00:18:11,526 --> 00:18:13,506
Xcode from your project info and


579
00:18:13,506 --> 00:18:15,496
you have over 100 languages to


580
00:18:15,496 --> 00:18:16,096
choose from.


581
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:18,306
So now that you've added these


582
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,616
languages that you want to


583
00:18:19,616 --> 00:18:21,376
support in your app, so to


584
00:18:21,376 --> 00:18:23,196
generate the localizable content


585
00:18:23,246 --> 00:18:25,506
for your translators Xcode will


586
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:27,196
find all the localizable


587
00:18:27,196 --> 00:18:28,866
resources that you have in your


588
00:18:28,956 --> 00:18:30,926
project, then when you export


589
00:18:30,926 --> 00:18:32,536
your projects for localization


590
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:34,746
Xcode will extract the strings


591
00:18:34,846 --> 00:18:36,496
from this localizable resources


592
00:18:36,856 --> 00:18:38,986
and generate XLIFF files for


593
00:18:38,986 --> 00:18:40,326
every single language that you


594
00:18:40,326 --> 00:18:40,896
have added.


595
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:43,176
And XLIFF file is simply a


596
00:18:43,176 --> 00:18:45,546
standard XML localization file


597
00:18:45,546 --> 00:18:47,126
format that is standard in the


598
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,366
localization industry.


599
00:18:48,826 --> 00:18:50,616
So if you send your XLIFF files


600
00:18:50,616 --> 00:18:51,916
to one of the localizers they


601
00:18:52,076 --> 00:18:53,516
will be already familiar with


602
00:18:53,516 --> 00:18:54,956
the formats and how to work with


603
00:18:54,956 --> 00:18:55,116
it.


604
00:18:56,276 --> 00:18:57,586
So once your XLIFF files are


605
00:18:57,586 --> 00:18:59,546
translated you can import them


606
00:18:59,546 --> 00:19:02,696
back and Xcode will integrate


607
00:19:02,696 --> 00:19:04,716
automatically your localized


608
00:19:04,716 --> 00:19:06,646
text back into your project.


609
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:08,436
And that's the localization


610
00:19:08,436 --> 00:19:09,606
process in Xcode.


611
00:19:09,786 --> 00:19:11,016
It's very simple and


612
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:11,736
straightforward.


613
00:19:13,226 --> 00:19:15,266
And new in Xcode 9 we are adding


614
00:19:15,326 --> 00:19:17,496
support for exporting and


615
00:19:17,496 --> 00:19:19,836
importing string dics file


616
00:19:20,006 --> 00:19:20,536
formats.


617
00:19:21,516 --> 00:19:23,116
So string dics is the powerful


618
00:19:23,116 --> 00:19:24,796
tool that lets you handle


619
00:19:24,986 --> 00:19:26,996
plurals and adaptive strings in


620
00:19:26,996 --> 00:19:27,556
your app.


621
00:19:29,116 --> 00:19:31,646
In Xcode 9 you can now add and


622
00:19:31,646 --> 00:19:33,646
create string dictionaries right


623
00:19:33,646 --> 00:19:35,616
from the file template list in


624
00:19:35,616 --> 00:19:37,926
Xcode and that will generate an


625
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,926
editor for you where you can add


626
00:19:40,036 --> 00:19:41,966
and edit your keys and values.


627
00:19:42,596 --> 00:19:45,446
So now let's talk more in detail


628
00:19:45,446 --> 00:19:46,796
about what can you do with


629
00:19:46,796 --> 00:19:48,246
strings dictionaries and why


630
00:19:48,246 --> 00:19:48,986
they are helpful.


631
00:19:49,936 --> 00:19:51,506
So first strings dictionaries


632
00:19:51,506 --> 00:19:53,366
can help you handle the


633
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:54,966
complexity of plural forms


634
00:19:54,966 --> 00:19:56,936
without writing any code in your


635
00:19:57,556 --> 00:19:57,626
app.


636
00:19:58,196 --> 00:20:00,236
So let's assume I have this


637
00:20:00,236 --> 00:20:02,166
logic in my code to handle


638
00:20:02,226 --> 00:20:03,106
plural variants.


639
00:20:03,556 --> 00:20:05,066
So here I have an array.


640
00:20:05,556 --> 00:20:07,206
If the count of my array is one


641
00:20:07,596 --> 00:20:09,896
I set my string to one popular


642
00:20:09,896 --> 00:20:10,486
language.


643
00:20:10,846 --> 00:20:13,426
Else if the count of my array is


644
00:20:13,426 --> 00:20:15,416
more than one I set my string


645
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,006
here to something like person d


646
00:20:17,006 --> 00:20:19,276
popular languages where person d


647
00:20:19,276 --> 00:20:20,576
is a format string that will


648
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:22,136
replace the runtime with the


649
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:23,116
count of my array.


650
00:20:23,906 --> 00:20:26,166
So this logic might work -- well


651
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,916
it would work for a language


652
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,256
like English where there are


653
00:20:29,386 --> 00:20:31,096
only two plural forms; one


654
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,296
singular and one plural.


655
00:20:33,386 --> 00:20:34,626
But this would be a complete


656
00:20:34,626 --> 00:20:36,436
disaster for a language like


657
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:38,046
Russian where there are more


658
00:20:38,046 --> 00:20:39,126
plural variants.


659
00:20:39,546 --> 00:20:41,056
So Russian has four different


660
00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:42,616
plural variants and your


661
00:20:42,756 --> 00:20:44,216
translators need to think about


662
00:20:44,456 --> 00:20:46,166
work arounds and ways on how to


663
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,536
translate all these variants


664
00:20:47,536 --> 00:20:49,506
with the one generic plural that


665
00:20:49,746 --> 00:20:50,886
you provided -- the one you are


666
00:20:50,886 --> 00:20:52,746
using for English, which will


667
00:20:52,806 --> 00:20:56,256
make basically your translations


668
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:57,626
sound robotic and not very


669
00:20:57,626 --> 00:20:59,256
natural for a native speaker.


670
00:20:59,516 --> 00:21:03,006
So this example here sounds like


671
00:21:03,006 --> 00:21:04,636
something; "popular languages


672
00:21:04,636 --> 00:21:06,096
column one, popular languages


673
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,506
column two," and you don't want


674
00:21:07,586 --> 00:21:09,156
that in your app.


675
00:21:09,306 --> 00:21:10,416
So to solve this kind of


676
00:21:10,516 --> 00:21:13,436
problem, when we're done writing


677
00:21:13,436 --> 00:21:15,126
any code you can just use


678
00:21:15,386 --> 00:21:16,306
strings dictionaries.


679
00:21:17,246 --> 00:21:18,786
So all you need to do in your


680
00:21:18,786 --> 00:21:20,816
strings dics file -- so you need


681
00:21:20,816 --> 00:21:23,186
to add your localized format


682
00:21:23,186 --> 00:21:23,456
key.


683
00:21:24,296 --> 00:21:25,876
In this example my localized


684
00:21:25,876 --> 00:21:27,446
format key is "languages."


685
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,566
Then you need to add the plural


686
00:21:30,566 --> 00:21:32,256
variants that are relevant for


687
00:21:32,256 --> 00:21:34,596
your development language.


688
00:21:34,756 --> 00:21:36,176
So since here my development


689
00:21:36,176 --> 00:21:37,936
language is English, I only care


690
00:21:37,936 --> 00:21:39,726
about two plural variants, one


691
00:21:39,726 --> 00:21:40,246
and other.


692
00:21:40,246 --> 00:21:41,896
So one is for the singular case


693
00:21:42,186 --> 00:21:43,736
and other is for the plural


694
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:44,046
case.


695
00:21:45,526 --> 00:21:47,596
Then by wrapping your plural


696
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,436
string with NS Localized String,


697
00:21:49,826 --> 00:21:51,876
as you will do with any other


698
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:53,386
string that you have in your


699
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:55,246
code, when you export your


700
00:21:55,286 --> 00:21:57,046
projects for localization, Xcode


701
00:21:57,046 --> 00:21:59,126
will generate automatically for


702
00:21:59,126 --> 00:22:01,046
you the plural keys for other


703
00:22:01,046 --> 00:22:02,306
languages that you support.


704
00:22:02,816 --> 00:22:05,576
So the variance for other


705
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:07,126
languages will be included in


706
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:08,826
your XK files and your


707
00:22:08,926 --> 00:22:09,866
translators when they are


708
00:22:10,016 --> 00:22:11,496
translating the strings they


709
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,256
will find the plural variants


710
00:22:13,256 --> 00:22:14,536
that are relevant for the


711
00:22:14,536 --> 00:22:15,086
language.


712
00:22:15,596 --> 00:22:17,166
And now our translation will be


713
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,736
correct and your users will have


714
00:22:18,736 --> 00:22:20,296
more grammatically correct


715
00:22:20,296 --> 00:22:21,016
translations.


716
00:22:21,756 --> 00:22:23,436
So this is Strings Dics support


717
00:22:23,436 --> 00:22:26,426
for Plural Variants in Xcode 9.


718
00:22:27,106 --> 00:22:28,776
Another thing you can do with


719
00:22:28,776 --> 00:22:30,666
strings dictionaries in Xcode 9


720
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,536
is support for adaptive strings.


721
00:22:33,456 --> 00:22:36,256
So if we take this example from


722
00:22:36,576 --> 00:22:39,316
Ia's app earlier, she had a


723
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,166
string here called "Gross


724
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:42,696
Domestic Products in Billions,"


725
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:44,066
which is kind of long, but it


726
00:22:44,066 --> 00:22:45,406
fits fine on an iPad because


727
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:46,816
there is enough space for it.


728
00:22:47,636 --> 00:22:49,366
If we run the app again in a


729
00:22:49,366 --> 00:22:51,546
smaller device like an iPhone 7


730
00:22:52,436 --> 00:22:53,716
-- so this string does not fit


731
00:22:53,716 --> 00:22:54,206
anymore.


732
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,616
As you can see on the screen,


733
00:22:55,616 --> 00:22:56,936
the number on the right side now


734
00:22:56,986 --> 00:22:58,566
shrinks and you can only read


735
00:22:58,566 --> 00:22:59,606
the three first characters,


736
00:22:59,606 --> 00:23:00,766
which is kind of wrong because


737
00:23:00,766 --> 00:23:01,486
we are given the wrong


738
00:23:01,486 --> 00:23:02,626
information to the user.


739
00:23:03,706 --> 00:23:05,736
So you can take advantage of


740
00:23:06,186 --> 00:23:07,866
strings dictionaries again to


741
00:23:07,866 --> 00:23:09,216
solve these kinds of problems


742
00:23:09,476 --> 00:23:10,996
and provide different string


743
00:23:10,996 --> 00:23:12,486
variants for your app.


744
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:14,506
So here I have three different


745
00:23:14,506 --> 00:23:17,086
keys; 20, 25, and 50.


746
00:23:17,366 --> 00:23:18,556
They correspond to different


747
00:23:18,556 --> 00:23:19,336
screen sizes.


748
00:23:19,336 --> 00:23:21,586
And then I have the strings that


749
00:23:21,586 --> 00:23:23,246
I want to show for every screen


750
00:23:23,246 --> 00:23:23,606
size.


751
00:23:24,346 --> 00:23:26,586
So if you call NS Localized


752
00:23:26,676 --> 00:23:28,796
Strings on the key within your


753
00:23:28,796 --> 00:23:29,736
strings dics file.


754
00:23:30,386 --> 00:23:31,706
So you enable -- we pick the


755
00:23:31,706 --> 00:23:34,096
right value for you at runtime


756
00:23:34,196 --> 00:23:36,266
based on the space available on


757
00:23:36,266 --> 00:23:36,826
the screen.


758
00:23:37,856 --> 00:23:39,596
So if you are not using UI label


759
00:23:39,596 --> 00:23:40,606
and you are using a custom


760
00:23:40,606 --> 00:23:42,626
control of your own, you can


761
00:23:42,626 --> 00:23:44,196
still take advantage of the


762
00:23:44,196 --> 00:23:46,096
functionality by calling


763
00:23:46,236 --> 00:23:47,926
variance fit in presentation


764
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,476
with API, where you pass in one


765
00:23:50,476 --> 00:23:51,496
of the keys that you have


766
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:53,146
defined in your strings dics


767
00:23:53,146 --> 00:23:54,956
file and then at runtime this


768
00:23:54,956 --> 00:23:56,446
will choose the right value for


769
00:23:56,446 --> 00:23:57,746
you that corresponds to that


770
00:23:57,746 --> 00:23:57,876
key.


771
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:00,696
And we will be providing the


772
00:24:00,696 --> 00:24:02,186
keys and the corresponding


773
00:24:02,186 --> 00:24:03,266
screen sizes in the


774
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:04,756
documentation if you would like


775
00:24:04,756 --> 00:24:05,746
to check out that later.


776
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:09,156
So now if we run again the app


777
00:24:09,346 --> 00:24:11,036
on the iPad, still using the


778
00:24:11,036 --> 00:24:13,556
full string, and if we run it


779
00:24:13,556 --> 00:24:15,196
again in a smaller device like


780
00:24:15,196 --> 00:24:17,226
an iPhone 7 now we pick the


781
00:24:17,226 --> 00:24:18,546
right variant that will fit


782
00:24:18,716 --> 00:24:20,486
nicely on the screen size.


783
00:24:21,286 --> 00:24:22,316
And thus without erasing a


784
00:24:22,396 --> 00:24:23,946
single line of code your app


785
00:24:23,946 --> 00:24:26,066
looks nice and beautiful in all


786
00:24:26,196 --> 00:24:27,526
different screen sizes and


787
00:24:27,526 --> 00:24:29,316
configurations of your app.


788
00:24:29,316 --> 00:24:30,776
And adaptive strings are really


789
00:24:30,776 --> 00:24:32,496
helpful if you are supporting


790
00:24:32,496 --> 00:24:33,726
localizations in your app


791
00:24:33,856 --> 00:24:34,896
because you might have some


792
00:24:34,896 --> 00:24:36,466
languages that are longer or


793
00:24:36,466 --> 00:24:38,056
shorter than others and you want


794
00:24:38,056 --> 00:24:39,426
to give this flexibility to your


795
00:24:39,426 --> 00:24:41,496
translators to provide like


796
00:24:41,496 --> 00:24:42,686
adaptive strings for the


797
00:24:42,686 --> 00:24:43,216
language.


798
00:24:44,936 --> 00:24:46,266
So now that you're done with


799
00:24:46,266 --> 00:24:48,316
supporting plural support as


800
00:24:48,316 --> 00:24:50,286
well as adaptive strings you are


801
00:24:50,286 --> 00:24:52,556
ready to localize your app.


802
00:24:52,556 --> 00:24:53,516
And the first step in


803
00:24:53,516 --> 00:24:55,926
localization is exporting your


804
00:24:55,926 --> 00:24:56,596
project.


805
00:24:57,006 --> 00:24:58,326
So when you export your projects


806
00:24:58,326 --> 00:25:00,126
for localization -- so Xcode


807
00:25:00,126 --> 00:25:01,436
will ask you which languages you


808
00:25:01,436 --> 00:25:02,966
want to localize first.


809
00:25:03,006 --> 00:25:04,506
So once you pick the language


810
00:25:04,506 --> 00:25:06,386
you want Xcode will generate


811
00:25:06,526 --> 00:25:09,076
XLIFF files for you to send to


812
00:25:09,186 --> 00:25:09,806
your translators.


813
00:25:10,236 --> 00:25:11,516
So once your XLIFF files are


814
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:14,026
translated you can import them


815
00:25:14,026 --> 00:25:16,196
back in your project and Xcode


816
00:25:16,196 --> 00:25:17,646
will show you this nice diff


817
00:25:17,926 --> 00:25:19,796
with what was changed by your


818
00:25:19,926 --> 00:25:20,616
translators.


819
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:24,046
And after that Xcode will just


820
00:25:24,046 --> 00:25:25,416
integrate your localized text


821
00:25:25,576 --> 00:25:27,136
back into your project and your


822
00:25:27,136 --> 00:25:28,886
strings will be localized.


823
00:25:29,436 --> 00:25:31,616
So now that your strings are


824
00:25:31,616 --> 00:25:33,126
localized, what about other


825
00:25:33,126 --> 00:25:34,636
resources that are not string


826
00:25:34,636 --> 00:25:36,986
based that you want -- probably


827
00:25:36,986 --> 00:25:38,136
you want to localize, like


828
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,566
images or audio files?


829
00:25:39,656 --> 00:25:42,036
So you might have something like


830
00:25:42,036 --> 00:25:44,336
this, an image that has text on


831
00:25:44,366 --> 00:25:46,136
it, and you want to provide an


832
00:25:46,136 --> 00:25:47,566
alternative image for other


833
00:25:47,566 --> 00:25:48,186
languages.


834
00:25:48,616 --> 00:25:50,256
So you can localize other


835
00:25:50,536 --> 00:25:52,866
resources in Xcode easily by


836
00:25:52,866 --> 00:25:54,346
clicking the "localize" button


837
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:55,786
in the "file inspector."


838
00:25:56,336 --> 00:25:58,356
Again Xcode will ask you which


839
00:25:58,356 --> 00:25:59,576
language you want to localize


840
00:25:59,576 --> 00:26:00,426
this asset for.


841
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:02,066
You can pick from the list of


842
00:26:02,146 --> 00:26:04,426
your languages and Xcode will


843
00:26:04,426 --> 00:26:06,436
move this asset to the specific


844
00:26:06,436 --> 00:26:08,326
language folder where you can


845
00:26:08,326 --> 00:26:09,916
replace it with the image or the


846
00:26:09,996 --> 00:26:11,546
asset that you want to show for


847
00:26:11,546 --> 00:26:12,346
that language.


848
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:14,756
So this is the localization


849
00:26:14,756 --> 00:26:16,196
workflow in Xcode 9.


850
00:26:16,646 --> 00:26:19,186
So we saw how to support plurals


851
00:26:19,276 --> 00:26:21,056
as well as adaptive strings and


852
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,586
how to localize other resources.


853
00:26:23,006 --> 00:26:24,286
And with that I would like to


854
00:26:24,326 --> 00:26:26,256
call Chris on stage to give you


855
00:26:26,256 --> 00:26:26,586
a demo.


856
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:26,916
Thank you.


857
00:26:27,016 --> 00:26:29,000
[ Applause ]


858
00:26:29,246 --> 00:26:29,786
>> Thank you, Sarah.


859
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:29,983
>> Yeah.


860
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,000
[ Applause ]


861
00:26:41,236 --> 00:26:44,256
>> So earlier we saw Ia validate


862
00:26:44,556 --> 00:26:45,136
that her app as


863
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:47,206
internationalized using both our


864
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:49,066
framework and tools features.


865
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:51,456
So let's get started on actually


866
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:52,856
localizing it.


867
00:26:52,966 --> 00:26:54,036
First though, I really


868
00:26:54,036 --> 00:26:55,526
appreciated Sarah's discussion


869
00:26:55,526 --> 00:26:56,956
of plurals and adaptive width


870
00:26:56,956 --> 00:26:57,476
strings.


871
00:26:58,206 --> 00:26:59,866
So I've added a strings dict


872
00:26:59,866 --> 00:27:01,166
file to our project here.


873
00:27:03,686 --> 00:27:04,286
Oops. [laughs]


874
00:27:13,136 --> 00:27:15,996
And I've added that GDP adaptive


875
00:27:16,036 --> 00:27:19,116
width string with all of the


876
00:27:19,116 --> 00:27:20,656
different variants for our


877
00:27:20,656 --> 00:27:23,246
different device widths; 20, 25,


878
00:27:23,506 --> 00:27:24,126
and 50.


879
00:27:25,196 --> 00:27:26,996
And I've also created a plural


880
00:27:26,996 --> 00:27:28,636
variant, just like Sarah showed,


881
00:27:29,886 --> 00:27:31,296
for the number of popular


882
00:27:31,296 --> 00:27:32,066
languages.


883
00:27:32,646 --> 00:27:35,836
Now though, I'm ready to


884
00:27:35,836 --> 00:27:37,786
localize my application into


885
00:27:37,786 --> 00:27:38,196
Russian.


886
00:27:39,156 --> 00:27:40,586
So what I'm going to do is go to


887
00:27:40,586 --> 00:27:42,996
the project editor and right


888
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:44,856
under my localizations, where it


889
00:27:44,856 --> 00:27:46,016
tells me that English is my


890
00:27:46,016 --> 00:27:47,546
development language, I have


891
00:27:47,546 --> 00:27:48,346
this plus button.


892
00:27:48,746 --> 00:27:50,346
I can choose that and just go


893
00:27:50,346 --> 00:27:51,996
about halfway down and choose


894
00:27:52,036 --> 00:27:52,436
Russian.


895
00:27:53,126 --> 00:27:54,986
And Xcode will ask me which of


896
00:27:54,986 --> 00:27:57,116
my resources I want to take and


897
00:27:57,116 --> 00:27:58,916
make Russian placeholders for.


898
00:28:00,366 --> 00:28:01,536
Since I want to localize


899
00:28:01,536 --> 00:28:03,066
everything I'm just going to


900
00:28:03,066 --> 00:28:04,076
tell Xcode to finish.


901
00:28:04,586 --> 00:28:08,546
And you can see that in addition


902
00:28:08,546 --> 00:28:10,896
to my main storyboard file I now


903
00:28:10,896 --> 00:28:12,746
have a placeholder for my


904
00:28:12,746 --> 00:28:13,786
Russian strings.


905
00:28:15,046 --> 00:28:17,796
Still in the project editor, I'm


906
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,026
going to go to the "editor" menu


907
00:28:19,026 --> 00:28:20,676
now and I'm going to export my


908
00:28:20,676 --> 00:28:22,086
project for localization.


909
00:28:22,626 --> 00:28:26,856
And I'm just going to save this


910
00:28:26,856 --> 00:28:28,826
file -- actually this folder --


911
00:28:29,196 --> 00:28:32,276
on the desktop and Xcode is


912
00:28:32,276 --> 00:28:33,516
going to read through all of my


913
00:28:33,516 --> 00:28:34,606
source code, all of my


914
00:28:34,606 --> 00:28:36,226
resources, and it's going to


915
00:28:36,226 --> 00:28:38,266
generate that XLIFF file.


916
00:28:38,266 --> 00:28:39,626
So let's take a look at what it


917
00:28:39,626 --> 00:28:39,976
looks like.


918
00:28:45,066 --> 00:28:45,906
Here you can see that the file


919
00:28:45,906 --> 00:28:49,386
is named "ru.xliff" where ru is


920
00:28:49,386 --> 00:28:51,026
the ISO language code for the


921
00:28:51,026 --> 00:28:51,846
Russian language.


922
00:28:52,256 --> 00:28:54,296
And if I double click this we


923
00:28:54,296 --> 00:28:55,286
have a little tool that we've


924
00:28:55,286 --> 00:28:57,446
written so that we can see all


925
00:28:57,446 --> 00:28:59,076
of this localization data in


926
00:28:59,076 --> 00:29:00,396
sort of a tabular form so that


927
00:29:00,396 --> 00:29:01,456
we don't have to wade through a


928
00:29:01,456 --> 00:29:02,626
whole bunch of XML angle


929
00:29:02,626 --> 00:29:04,376
brackets just to show you.


930
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:09,696
And up at the top here you can


931
00:29:09,696 --> 00:29:11,446
see a bunch of strings that came


932
00:29:11,446 --> 00:29:12,786
directly from our storyboard


933
00:29:12,786 --> 00:29:13,156
file.


934
00:29:14,606 --> 00:29:15,886
And you can see in our


935
00:29:15,886 --> 00:29:17,296
translation column everything is


936
00:29:17,296 --> 00:29:18,326
in red because we haven't


937
00:29:18,326 --> 00:29:20,396
actually put any translations in


938
00:29:20,396 --> 00:29:22,656
this XLIFF file yet.


939
00:29:23,906 --> 00:29:25,716
Here in the next section we have


940
00:29:26,176 --> 00:29:28,066
file -- we have elements that


941
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,716
will go into our localized


942
00:29:29,966 --> 00:29:30,886
strings -- our


943
00:29:30,886 --> 00:29:33,236
localizable.stringsdict file.


944
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:35,626
And you can see that there are


945
00:29:35,626 --> 00:29:38,526
more variants of the percent d


946
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:41,776
popular languages string than we


947
00:29:41,776 --> 00:29:43,056
had in our original


948
00:29:43,136 --> 00:29:44,576
localizable.stringsdict.


949
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,356
And this is because Xcode knows


950
00:29:46,356 --> 00:29:47,766
that we're exporting to Russian


951
00:29:48,096 --> 00:29:49,716
and creates placeholders for all


952
00:29:49,716 --> 00:29:51,266
of the Russian variants for you


953
00:29:51,266 --> 00:29:51,996
automatically.


954
00:29:53,556 --> 00:29:55,426
We also have our adaptive width


955
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:57,756
string variants for the gross


956
00:29:57,756 --> 00:30:00,166
domestic product and we have a


957
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:02,536
couple other things like our


958
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:03,636
application name and our


959
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:06,726
info.plist and the strings from


960
00:30:06,726 --> 00:30:08,806
our source code that will then


961
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:09,886
show up in a Russian


962
00:30:09,886 --> 00:30:12,316
localizable.strings file upon


963
00:30:12,316 --> 00:30:12,736
import.


964
00:30:13,636 --> 00:30:14,586
Now let's say I have a


965
00:30:14,586 --> 00:30:16,056
translator who worked really


966
00:30:16,056 --> 00:30:19,936
fast and I have a translated


967
00:30:19,936 --> 00:30:22,676
version of this XLIFF ready to


968
00:30:22,676 --> 00:30:23,006
go.


969
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:25,176
I could just go to the project


970
00:30:25,176 --> 00:30:27,656
editor in Xcode and choose


971
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:31,496
"import localizations" and just


972
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:35,216
choose that file and export --


973
00:30:35,216 --> 00:30:36,556
Xcode will read your project,


974
00:30:36,796 --> 00:30:39,026
read the file, and then show you


975
00:30:39,206 --> 00:30:41,096
how what that file is importing


976
00:30:41,246 --> 00:30:42,366
differs from your project.


977
00:30:42,696 --> 00:30:43,826
Here I'm just getting a warning


978
00:30:43,826 --> 00:30:45,836
that I didn't actually localize


979
00:30:46,586 --> 00:30:48,636
the name of my app in English


980
00:30:48,636 --> 00:30:50,076
yet, but I do have a


981
00:30:50,076 --> 00:30:51,576
localization now in Russian.


982
00:30:52,706 --> 00:30:55,026
And I can also see in the files


983
00:30:55,026 --> 00:30:57,526
view here exactly what files


984
00:30:57,526 --> 00:30:59,396
will be affected by this import.


985
00:30:59,726 --> 00:31:03,036
And this is all what I expect.


986
00:31:03,436 --> 00:31:04,966
Now I tell Xcode to import it


987
00:31:04,966 --> 00:31:07,076
and it'll write out these new


988
00:31:07,076 --> 00:31:08,336
resource files for me.


989
00:31:08,336 --> 00:31:09,626
And you can see that where we


990
00:31:09,626 --> 00:31:10,396
didn't have a


991
00:31:10,396 --> 00:31:12,616
localizable.strings file before,


992
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,866
now we have one.


993
00:31:14,286 --> 00:31:16,256
And if I choose it we have a


994
00:31:16,256 --> 00:31:18,346
localizable.strings file with a


995
00:31:18,346 --> 00:31:21,336
whole bunch of Russian text.


996
00:31:22,706 --> 00:31:24,506
Now if I run our application --


997
00:31:25,446 --> 00:31:26,746
it looks like I've hit a little


998
00:31:26,746 --> 00:31:28,186
bug here, that's okay.


999
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,936
Oops. I'll just quit and


1000
00:31:32,176 --> 00:31:32,976
relaunch Xcode.


1001
00:31:44,306 --> 00:31:45,506
Now if I run our application


1002
00:31:45,806 --> 00:31:47,346
we're building and Xcode is


1003
00:31:47,396 --> 00:31:49,176
integrating all of our


1004
00:31:49,226 --> 00:31:50,736
localizable strings that we just


1005
00:31:50,736 --> 00:31:50,976
imported.


1006
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:56,746
There is one step that I missed


1007
00:31:56,746 --> 00:31:57,886
though, sorry about that.


1008
00:31:58,546 --> 00:32:01,256
I want to run my application in


1009
00:32:01,256 --> 00:32:02,576
Russian so I can see those


1010
00:32:02,576 --> 00:32:03,346
translations.


1011
00:32:03,346 --> 00:32:05,106
So I'm just going to open the


1012
00:32:05,106 --> 00:32:06,726
scheme editor and I'm going to


1013
00:32:06,726 --> 00:32:07,886
switch from that right to left


1014
00:32:07,886 --> 00:32:09,396
pseudo language that I was using


1015
00:32:11,076 --> 00:32:12,216
to the Russian language.


1016
00:32:12,876 --> 00:32:14,826
And now if I run our application


1017
00:32:15,766 --> 00:32:17,486
it'll build the storyboard, copy


1018
00:32:17,486 --> 00:32:18,836
in the swift standard libraries,


1019
00:32:19,506 --> 00:32:20,226
and launch.


1020
00:32:21,956 --> 00:32:23,246
And we can see our application


1021
00:32:23,246 --> 00:32:24,286
is running in Russian.


1022
00:32:24,666 --> 00:32:26,076
And not only are all the


1023
00:32:26,076 --> 00:32:27,376
formatters and everything


1024
00:32:27,376 --> 00:32:29,496
correct for all of our dates and


1025
00:32:29,496 --> 00:32:32,926
our numbers, but we also have


1026
00:32:32,926 --> 00:32:35,226
all of that Russian text that we


1027
00:32:35,226 --> 00:32:35,976
just imported.


1028
00:32:49,236 --> 00:32:51,466
So, to summarize, strings dicts


1029
00:32:51,466 --> 00:32:53,176
are really powerful and you can


1030
00:32:53,176 --> 00:32:55,366
use them for pluralization and


1031
00:32:55,426 --> 00:32:57,276
for adaptive width strings in


1032
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:59,016
your applications to ensure that


1033
00:32:59,016 --> 00:33:01,326
they look right not only based


1034
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:03,036
on the user's language, but also


1035
00:33:03,036 --> 00:33:04,196
based on their device width.


1036
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:08,216
It's easy to export an XLIFF


1037
00:33:08,316 --> 00:33:10,456
from your Xcode application for


1038
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:13,516
your localization process and to


1039
00:33:13,576 --> 00:33:15,356
import your translated strings


1040
00:33:15,356 --> 00:33:17,396
via XLIFF back into your


1041
00:33:17,396 --> 00:33:19,216
application's Xcode project.


1042
00:33:20,876 --> 00:33:22,586
And Sarah showed us how you can


1043
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:24,746
also localize non-string


1044
00:33:24,746 --> 00:33:26,486
resources in Xcode.


1045
00:33:27,886 --> 00:33:30,716
And now Ia is going to show us


1046
00:33:31,026 --> 00:33:32,446
how you can test your


1047
00:33:32,446 --> 00:33:33,866
localization.


1048
00:33:34,516 --> 00:33:41,500
[ Applause ]


1049
00:33:42,046 --> 00:33:42,576
>> Thanks, Chris.


1050
00:33:42,576 --> 00:33:44,406
I can't believe that my app is


1051
00:33:44,406 --> 00:33:45,966
already localized into its first


1052
00:33:45,966 --> 00:33:47,456
language and the steps were


1053
00:33:47,456 --> 00:33:48,516
really simple and easy to


1054
00:33:48,516 --> 00:33:48,826
follow.


1055
00:33:50,066 --> 00:33:51,556
So now that I do have my


1056
00:33:51,556 --> 00:33:53,286
localization, let's talk about


1057
00:33:53,286 --> 00:33:54,516
some things that we could do to


1058
00:33:54,516 --> 00:33:54,976
test it.


1059
00:33:56,436 --> 00:33:58,586
New in Xcode 9 we've introduced


1060
00:33:58,586 --> 00:34:00,356
the ability to specify the


1061
00:34:00,356 --> 00:34:02,376
application language and region


1062
00:34:02,526 --> 00:34:03,556
that you would like to run your


1063
00:34:03,556 --> 00:34:04,156
tests in.


1064
00:34:04,706 --> 00:34:06,096
And you can do this in the test


1065
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:07,896
scheme editor right in Xcode.


1066
00:34:08,356 --> 00:34:11,496
And today I want to talk about


1067
00:34:11,496 --> 00:34:13,146
UI testing with XC test.


1068
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,226
So UI testing is a great way for


1069
00:34:16,226 --> 00:34:17,496
you to validate both your


1070
00:34:17,496 --> 00:34:19,446
application's UI as well as its


1071
00:34:19,446 --> 00:34:20,166
functionality.


1072
00:34:21,335 --> 00:34:23,326
Let's take this line of code on


1073
00:34:23,326 --> 00:34:24,315
the screen for example.


1074
00:34:25,466 --> 00:34:26,666
This is what you would write to


1075
00:34:26,666 --> 00:34:28,886
simulate tapping on a table cell


1076
00:34:28,886 --> 00:34:30,496
that has the text territory in


1077
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:31,306
it.


1078
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:33,706
Now that's not going to work for


1079
00:34:33,706 --> 00:34:35,866
localization because that text


1080
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:37,525
is going to be translated into


1081
00:34:37,525 --> 00:34:38,856
each language that you run your


1082
00:34:38,856 --> 00:34:39,386
test in.


1083
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,476
And additionally, if you decide


1084
00:34:41,476 --> 00:34:42,726
to go and change the wording in


1085
00:34:42,726 --> 00:34:43,835
your app, even in your


1086
00:34:43,835 --> 00:34:45,295
development language -- like


1087
00:34:45,295 --> 00:34:46,286
let's say I want to call it


1088
00:34:46,286 --> 00:34:47,356
"region" now instead of


1089
00:34:47,356 --> 00:34:49,085
"territory," you don't really


1090
00:34:49,085 --> 00:34:50,926
want to go back and update every


1091
00:34:50,926 --> 00:34:52,406
single test that you've written


1092
00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:53,866
just so that it can start


1093
00:34:53,866 --> 00:34:54,565
succeeding again.


1094
00:34:55,536 --> 00:34:57,136
So instead, what we recommend


1095
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,726
you do is use accessibility


1096
00:34:58,726 --> 00:34:59,436
identifiers.


1097
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:02,376
These identifiers are unique to


1098
00:35:02,376 --> 00:35:04,456
every element on your screen and


1099
00:35:04,456 --> 00:35:06,616
you can use them to find these


1100
00:35:06,616 --> 00:35:08,006
elements without really knowing


1101
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:08,886
what strings are loaded into


1102
00:35:08,886 --> 00:35:08,976
them.


1103
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:15,526
So to set the accessibility


1104
00:35:15,526 --> 00:35:17,406
identifier, you can simply set


1105
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,296
the property on your UI control


1106
00:35:19,296 --> 00:35:20,916
when create it, or your NS


1107
00:35:20,916 --> 00:35:21,286
control.


1108
00:35:23,086 --> 00:35:24,726
Or if you're loading your UI


1109
00:35:24,726 --> 00:35:26,486
from a storyboard or a zip file


1110
00:35:26,606 --> 00:35:28,016
you can set it in the identity


1111
00:35:28,016 --> 00:35:29,626
inspector in interface builder.


1112
00:35:30,226 --> 00:35:33,726
So now that your tests are


1113
00:35:33,726 --> 00:35:35,016
localization friendly and


1114
00:35:35,016 --> 00:35:36,566
they're succeeding in all the


1115
00:35:36,566 --> 00:35:37,756
languages that you support,


1116
00:35:38,776 --> 00:35:40,176
there's even more that you can


1117
00:35:40,176 --> 00:35:42,066
do to take advantage of that.


1118
00:35:42,906 --> 00:35:44,386
We're introducing -- this year


1119
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:46,006
we're introducing XCT attachment


1120
00:35:46,006 --> 00:35:48,096
APIs, which allow you to attach


1121
00:35:48,226 --> 00:35:49,996
screen shots as well as any


1122
00:35:49,996 --> 00:35:51,616
other data you collect during


1123
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:54,466
your test and it'll attach it to


1124
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:55,926
your test report at the end.


1125
00:35:56,766 --> 00:35:58,346
What this empowers you to do is


1126
00:35:58,346 --> 00:36:00,276
get a full coverage of your UI.


1127
00:36:00,906 --> 00:36:02,886
So every screen in your app, in


1128
00:36:02,886 --> 00:36:04,236
every localization that you


1129
00:36:04,236 --> 00:36:06,726
support, as well as every device


1130
00:36:06,726 --> 00:36:07,416
that you support.


1131
00:36:07,696 --> 00:36:09,116
And you can do all that while


1132
00:36:09,116 --> 00:36:11,786
writing only one test -- well,


1133
00:36:11,946 --> 00:36:13,836
one test for each thing you want


1134
00:36:14,936 --> 00:36:16,136
to test.


1135
00:36:16,136 --> 00:36:16,936
[laughing] To find out more


1136
00:36:16,936 --> 00:36:19,256
about XCT attachment and what


1137
00:36:19,256 --> 00:36:21,346
else is new in testing please


1138
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:23,906
see those related sessions


1139
00:36:23,946 --> 00:36:24,596
throughout the week.


1140
00:36:26,636 --> 00:36:27,976
And now I want to show you a


1141
00:36:27,976 --> 00:36:29,406
test that I've written for my


1142
00:36:29,406 --> 00:36:29,946
international facts app.


1143
00:36:42,526 --> 00:36:45,046
Okay. So in my Xcode project


1144
00:36:45,276 --> 00:36:46,926
I've already created this UI


1145
00:36:46,926 --> 00:36:49,356
test target and I wrote my first


1146
00:36:49,356 --> 00:36:50,566
test, called Test Some


1147
00:36:50,566 --> 00:36:51,206
Territories.


1148
00:36:51,866 --> 00:36:53,186
So let's run it to see what it


1149
00:36:53,186 --> 00:36:53,896
does exactly.


1150
00:36:59,276 --> 00:37:00,986
Now Xcode will launch my test


1151
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:05,926
runner, which in turn launches


1152
00:37:06,086 --> 00:37:07,466
my app.


1153
00:37:08,776 --> 00:37:11,196
And in this specific test we


1154
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:12,736
select a different territory, in


1155
00:37:12,736 --> 00:37:14,666
this case Belgium, and then the


1156
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:15,356
test succeeds.


1157
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:19,046
So now let's try running my test


1158
00:37:19,046 --> 00:37:19,576
in Russian.


1159
00:37:19,786 --> 00:37:21,686
And to do that I'll go into my


1160
00:37:21,686 --> 00:37:24,416
scheme and instead of "run" this


1161
00:37:24,456 --> 00:37:25,836
time we want to select "test"


1162
00:37:26,646 --> 00:37:28,266
and under language I'm going to


1163
00:37:28,266 --> 00:37:29,886
choose "Russian" so I can test


1164
00:37:29,966 --> 00:37:31,756
the new localization that Chris


1165
00:37:31,926 --> 00:37:32,906
added to my project.


1166
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,296
Now again my test runner


1167
00:37:38,296 --> 00:37:40,096
launches, which launches my app.


1168
00:37:42,396 --> 00:37:43,856
And this time my app is launched


1169
00:37:43,856 --> 00:37:48,726
in Russian, but it looks like my


1170
00:37:48,726 --> 00:37:49,506
test failed.


1171
00:37:50,076 --> 00:37:52,086
So let's see what's going on.


1172
00:37:52,796 --> 00:37:54,616
And it looks like my test can't


1173
00:37:54,616 --> 00:37:56,566
find a cell that has "territory"


1174
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:57,616
in it, which is what we just


1175
00:37:57,616 --> 00:37:58,216
talked about.


1176
00:37:58,696 --> 00:38:02,736
Silly me. So -- oops, sorry.


1177
00:38:09,046 --> 00:38:11,436
So in my project I'm going to go


1178
00:38:11,436 --> 00:38:13,066
back to my main table view


1179
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:14,416
controller and make sure that


1180
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:15,646
I'm setting an accessibility


1181
00:38:15,646 --> 00:38:18,876
identifier for my territory


1182
00:38:18,876 --> 00:38:20,666
picker cell so I can actually


1183
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:21,176
select it.


1184
00:38:21,776 --> 00:38:24,606
So when I create my cell I also


1185
00:38:24,606 --> 00:38:26,186
want to give it an identifier.


1186
00:38:26,296 --> 00:38:29,296
So territory picker cell.


1187
00:38:30,596 --> 00:38:31,956
And I want to use the same


1188
00:38:31,956 --> 00:38:33,466
identifier in my test.


1189
00:38:35,636 --> 00:38:37,296
So where it's failing, instead


1190
00:38:37,296 --> 00:38:40,316
of using static text I'll simply


1191
00:38:40,316 --> 00:38:41,496
replace it with this identifier


1192
00:38:41,496 --> 00:38:41,976
that I just created.


1193
00:38:48,106 --> 00:38:49,476
And now I'll try to run my test


1194
00:38:49,476 --> 00:38:50,406
again in Russian using the


1195
00:38:50,656 --> 00:38:50,976
identifiers.


1196
00:38:59,076 --> 00:39:00,046
As you can see, my app launches


1197
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,606
in Russian again, but this time


1198
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:03,426
it actually got further and it


1199
00:39:03,536 --> 00:39:05,416
chose Belgium as the country and


1200
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:06,236
the text succeeded.


1201
00:39:07,406 --> 00:39:08,526
So I just want to show you what


1202
00:39:08,526 --> 00:39:09,736
my test does exactly.


1203
00:39:10,376 --> 00:39:11,656
First, I want to validate some


1204
00:39:11,656 --> 00:39:12,836
of -- some functionality.


1205
00:39:12,836 --> 00:39:14,856
So I have this XCT assert equal


1206
00:39:14,856 --> 00:39:16,456
to make sure that my app


1207
00:39:16,456 --> 00:39:18,496
initially launches with the US


1208
00:39:18,496 --> 00:39:21,466
selected and then I use the XCT


1209
00:39:21,466 --> 00:39:24,856
attachment APIs to collect


1210
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:25,536
screen shots.


1211
00:39:25,686 --> 00:39:27,756
So my first screen shot is a


1212
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:30,446
screen shot of the US page.


1213
00:39:31,316 --> 00:39:33,196
And I add it to my test case and


1214
00:39:33,566 --> 00:39:35,186
then I collect more screen shots


1215
00:39:35,186 --> 00:39:37,786
later when I open the territory


1216
00:39:37,786 --> 00:39:39,496
list and after I've selected


1217
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:39,896
Belgium.


1218
00:39:41,026 --> 00:39:42,766
And now finally if I want to see


1219
00:39:42,766 --> 00:39:44,876
these attachments I can simply


1220
00:39:44,876 --> 00:39:46,886
go to the "reports" navigator in


1221
00:39:46,886 --> 00:39:50,096
the sidebar and select my most


1222
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,366
recent test that I've run.


1223
00:39:51,996 --> 00:39:54,656
And then if I expand my test


1224
00:39:54,716 --> 00:39:57,926
some territories test case,


1225
00:39:58,446 --> 00:39:59,666
you'll see that some of these


1226
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:01,626
lines have the attachment icon


1227
00:40:01,626 --> 00:40:02,536
on them.


1228
00:40:02,536 --> 00:40:03,586
And these are the attachments


1229
00:40:03,806 --> 00:40:04,926
that I've created.


1230
00:40:05,186 --> 00:40:07,006
So as I've mentioned, they're


1231
00:40:07,006 --> 00:40:08,356
all screen shots in this case.


1232
00:40:09,066 --> 00:40:10,856
And there's so much that I can


1233
00:40:10,856 --> 00:40:12,086
do with these attachments.


1234
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:14,076
I can bundle them up and send


1235
00:40:14,076 --> 00:40:16,426
them to somebody to ensure the


1236
00:40:16,426 --> 00:40:18,046
quality of my translations,


1237
00:40:18,046 --> 00:40:19,186
somebody who actually speaks


1238
00:40:19,186 --> 00:40:20,446
these different localizations --


1239
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:22,446
and to make sure the UI looks


1240
00:40:22,516 --> 00:40:24,856
good and the formatters are


1241
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:25,256
correct.


1242
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:28,146
And I can even use these screen


1243
00:40:28,146 --> 00:40:29,926
shots in my app store preview


1244
00:40:30,766 --> 00:40:32,346
when I want to launch my app in


1245
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,626
all these different storefronts


1246
00:40:33,626 --> 00:40:35,356
around the world so that users


1247
00:40:35,426 --> 00:40:36,816
can get a preview of what your


1248
00:40:36,816 --> 00:40:37,746
app will look like in their


1249
00:40:37,746 --> 00:40:37,976
language.


1250
00:40:43,476 --> 00:40:45,966
So, I show you how with one test


1251
00:40:46,606 --> 00:40:48,636
you can test every single


1252
00:40:48,636 --> 00:40:50,186
localization that you add in


1253
00:40:50,186 --> 00:40:50,616
your apps.


1254
00:40:51,356 --> 00:40:52,816
And to summarize what we talked


1255
00:40:52,816 --> 00:40:55,036
about today, we covered the


1256
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,156
localization process for an app.


1257
00:40:58,426 --> 00:40:59,976
First, you need to prepare your


1258
00:41:00,016 --> 00:41:01,556
code for localization, and


1259
00:41:01,556 --> 00:41:02,886
that's the internationalization


1260
00:41:02,886 --> 00:41:03,146
steps.


1261
00:41:03,146 --> 00:41:06,056
And then we showed you ways you


1262
00:41:06,056 --> 00:41:07,936
can validate your apps readiness


1263
00:41:08,296 --> 00:41:10,586
including the static analyzer


1264
00:41:10,586 --> 00:41:13,346
and auto layout warnings and the


1265
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:14,346
new pseudo languages.


1266
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:18,636
And then you can export your --


1267
00:41:18,636 --> 00:41:20,136
all your localizable content


1268
00:41:20,136 --> 00:41:21,386
into a single XLIFF.


1269
00:41:21,836 --> 00:41:23,236
And now that includes string


1270
00:41:23,236 --> 00:41:24,666
dict files, which are really


1271
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:26,536
powerful for handling plurals


1272
00:41:26,536 --> 00:41:27,616
and adaptive strings.


1273
00:41:29,036 --> 00:41:30,666
And finally, when your XLIFF is


1274
00:41:30,726 --> 00:41:32,676
translated you can import it


1275
00:41:32,676 --> 00:41:34,326
back into your project and that


1276
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:36,026
integrates the translations into


1277
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:37,496
all the different pieces of your


1278
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:37,606
app.


1279
00:41:39,326 --> 00:41:40,656
And then you can take advantage


1280
00:41:40,656 --> 00:41:42,896
of your existing tests to run


1281
00:41:42,896 --> 00:41:44,776
them in all your supported


1282
00:41:44,776 --> 00:41:45,636
localizations.


1283
00:41:45,856 --> 00:41:47,106
And you can take advantage of


1284
00:41:47,106 --> 00:41:48,896
the new XCT attachments to do a


1285
00:41:48,896 --> 00:41:51,266
lot more than test your app's


1286
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:51,906
functionality.


1287
00:41:53,606 --> 00:41:54,796
For more information, our


1288
00:41:54,796 --> 00:41:56,556

1293
00:42:02,496 --> 00:42:03,816
related sessions throughout the


1294
00:42:03,816 --> 00:42:04,146
week.


1295
00:42:05,726 --> 00:42:06,556
