[ Silence ]

00:00:07,516 --> 00:00:21,156
[ Applause ]


3
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:22,986
>> You all know that every app,


4
00:00:23,236 --> 00:00:24,776
even your app, needs an app


5
00:00:24,826 --> 00:00:25,206
icon.


6
00:00:25,706 --> 00:00:27,086
It's the symbol that represents


7
00:00:27,086 --> 00:00:28,876
your product on the Home screen


8
00:00:29,086 --> 00:00:29,816
and the App Store.


9
00:00:30,626 --> 00:00:32,566
Humanity has been using symbols


10
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,016
to communicate ideas since


11
00:00:34,016 --> 00:00:37,346
antiquity; even Apple was doing


12
00:00:37,346 --> 00:00:39,036
this a long, long time ago.


13
00:00:39,686 --> 00:00:40,516
I'm only joking.


14
00:00:40,576 --> 00:00:41,346
I'm only joking, of course.


15
00:00:41,456 --> 00:00:42,206
I hope there are no


16
00:00:42,206 --> 00:00:42,996
egyptologists [phonetic] in the


17
00:00:42,996 --> 00:00:43,766
room that were offended.


18
00:00:44,576 --> 00:00:45,756
But in all seriousness, we have


19
00:00:45,756 --> 00:00:47,486
a long rich history of using


20
00:00:48,026 --> 00:00:49,646
symbols, literal, non-literal,


21
00:00:49,646 --> 00:00:51,016
as a method of communication,


22
00:00:51,786 --> 00:00:53,326
and we extend this to the modern


23
00:00:53,326 --> 00:00:54,606
world, but we apply the same


24
00:00:54,606 --> 00:00:55,866
principles to the user interface


25
00:00:55,866 --> 00:00:56,086
design.


26
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:58,306
For example, there was your


27
00:00:58,306 --> 00:00:58,946
Macintosh.


28
00:00:59,206 --> 00:01:00,376
We're going to take a quick trip


29
00:01:00,376 --> 00:01:02,146
down memory lane and take a


30
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:03,736
closer look at some classic Mac


31
00:01:03,736 --> 00:01:04,836
OS icons.


32
00:01:05,426 --> 00:01:06,816
Many metaphors have stuck around


33
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,396
for three decades of Mac OS.


34
00:01:08,886 --> 00:01:10,596
Investing in simple application


35
00:01:10,596 --> 00:01:12,086
iconography was a way to


36
00:01:12,086 --> 00:01:13,736
emotionally relate to the user.


37
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:15,166
It made the system approachable


38
00:01:15,586 --> 00:01:16,646
and easy to use.


39
00:01:17,426 --> 00:01:19,246
It also made the platform unique


40
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,116
and stand apart from the


41
00:01:20,116 --> 00:01:20,736
competition.


42
00:01:21,906 --> 00:01:24,016
Many are close approximations of


43
00:01:24,016 --> 00:01:26,076
real world objects, and some


44
00:01:26,076 --> 00:01:27,446
concepts might be a little on


45
00:01:27,446 --> 00:01:29,166
the abstract side, but they all


46
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:30,386
live within a system that tells


47
00:01:30,386 --> 00:01:31,176
a user that they're


48
00:01:31,176 --> 00:01:31,906
interconnected.


49
00:01:32,276 --> 00:01:33,686
For example, they're


50
00:01:33,686 --> 00:01:34,826
appropriate; some are families,


51
00:01:34,826 --> 00:01:36,786
like families of maps or


52
00:01:36,786 --> 00:01:39,236
families of documents, and due


53
00:01:39,236 --> 00:01:40,796
to time, we've moved beyond some


54
00:01:41,036 --> 00:01:41,796
metaphors, either because the


55
00:01:41,796 --> 00:01:42,946
technology was surpassed, like


56
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,206
the floppy disc; remember those,


57
00:01:46,226 --> 00:01:47,446
or the metaphor we're seeing is


58
00:01:47,496 --> 00:01:48,676
too aggressive, like the bomb.


59
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:52,526
Or we had to learn a concept


60
00:01:52,526 --> 00:01:53,196
like the hieroglyph .


61
00:01:53,986 --> 00:01:55,436
Over time the face was removed,


62
00:01:55,436 --> 00:01:56,586
and we've come to notice there's


63
00:01:56,586 --> 00:01:57,856
just the explanation point.


64
00:01:58,976 --> 00:02:00,586
Even smaller glyphs share the


65
00:02:00,586 --> 00:02:01,326
same principle.


66
00:02:01,326 --> 00:02:02,266
So, let's take a close look at


67
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:03,366
one of my personal favorites,


68
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:03,926
the paint bucket.


69
00:02:04,846 --> 00:02:06,416
The paint bucket fills your


70
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:08,015
canvas with color, just like


71
00:02:08,015 --> 00:02:09,246
spilling a real can of paint on


72
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:09,626
the floor.


73
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,596
At the time, this was an


74
00:02:11,596 --> 00:02:12,886
abstract idea, but it was


75
00:02:12,886 --> 00:02:14,236
grounded here by a real world


76
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:14,636
object.


77
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:17,066
And how about how this was drawn


78
00:02:17,766 --> 00:02:18,826
even in those days?


79
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:20,366
Consider the consistency of line


80
00:02:20,366 --> 00:02:20,556
weight.


81
00:02:21,286 --> 00:02:22,626
There's implied movement in the


82
00:02:22,626 --> 00:02:25,346
angle, a subtle indication of


83
00:02:25,466 --> 00:02:26,046
perspective.


84
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:28,346
It's got a good balance of black


85
00:02:28,346 --> 00:02:28,666
and white.


86
00:02:28,886 --> 00:02:30,276
It's simple and high contrast.


87
00:02:30,886 --> 00:02:32,816
These examples represent some


88
00:02:32,816 --> 00:02:34,256
fundamental principles that we


89
00:02:34,256 --> 00:02:35,686
still use today when designing


90
00:02:35,796 --> 00:02:36,316
app icons.


91
00:02:37,196 --> 00:02:39,266
The first, metaphor, finding an


92
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:40,866
easily identifiable metaphor


93
00:02:41,266 --> 00:02:43,976
that will object or graphic logo


94
00:02:43,976 --> 00:02:44,836
a mark.


95
00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:46,736
The second, simplicity; your


96
00:02:46,736 --> 00:02:47,716
design should be simple and


97
00:02:47,716 --> 00:02:49,076
clear, no clutter or over


98
00:02:49,076 --> 00:02:49,706
complicate it.


99
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,356
If your icon is designed well,


100
00:02:51,356 --> 00:02:52,766
it should be quick and easy to


101
00:02:53,976 --> 00:02:54,066
read.


102
00:02:54,286 --> 00:02:54,696
Connection.


103
00:02:55,356 --> 00:02:56,866
Aiming to create an emotional


104
00:02:56,866 --> 00:02:58,536
connection with the user, the


105
00:02:58,536 --> 00:02:59,996
icon is the face of your app as


106
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:00,686
much as the UI.


107
00:03:01,256 --> 00:03:02,396
Keep it fun, keep it engaging.


108
00:03:02,396 --> 00:03:05,576
And lineage, make changes to


109
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:07,106
your icon meaningful and


110
00:03:07,106 --> 00:03:07,536
deliberate.


111
00:03:08,216 --> 00:03:09,466
Don't change your app icon every


112
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:10,786
single time that you update your


113
00:03:10,786 --> 00:03:11,006
app.


114
00:03:11,426 --> 00:03:12,786
Refine your identity over time.


115
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:14,986
So, let's think about some of


116
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,356
these principles as they related


117
00:03:16,356 --> 00:03:17,006
to an Apple app.


118
00:03:18,296 --> 00:03:20,416
Keynote. Since version 1, all


119
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,326
the way back in 2003, the app's


120
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:23,996
identity has been the podium.


121
00:03:24,886 --> 00:03:26,266
And why the podium, you ask?


122
00:03:26,986 --> 00:03:28,356
Well, the symbology is


123
00:03:28,356 --> 00:03:29,726
important, especially today of


124
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:30,066
all days.


125
00:03:30,656 --> 00:03:32,256
It is a real old metaphor that


126
00:03:32,256 --> 00:03:33,276
many can relate to.


127
00:03:34,106 --> 00:03:35,356
Presenters have used podiums for


128
00:03:35,356 --> 00:03:37,076
generations, and to add an


129
00:03:37,076 --> 00:03:38,106
emotional connection, the


130
00:03:38,106 --> 00:03:39,896
presenter notes rest on a warm


131
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:40,736
wooden surface.


132
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:42,326
The microphone adds a familiar


133
00:03:42,326 --> 00:03:42,716
detail.


134
00:03:43,196 --> 00:03:44,236
It immediately sets the stage


135
00:03:44,236 --> 00:03:46,666
for what keynote does, and we


136
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:47,716
didn't want to lose that.


137
00:03:47,756 --> 00:03:49,296
As keynote has moved from


138
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:50,896
version to version, we updated


139
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:51,626
the materials, and we've


140
00:03:51,696 --> 00:03:53,146
transitioned from a classic to a


141
00:03:53,146 --> 00:03:55,406
modern style, but the notion of


142
00:03:55,406 --> 00:03:56,306
the podium has remained


143
00:03:56,306 --> 00:03:56,946
consistent.


144
00:03:57,266 --> 00:03:58,566
The lineage provides users with


145
00:03:58,566 --> 00:03:59,566
a sense of familiarity.


146
00:04:00,346 --> 00:04:01,566
The podium was such a strong


147
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:02,656
mark that when we designed our


148
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:04,316
apps for iOS, we simplified the


149
00:04:04,316 --> 00:04:06,056
podium to more of a glyph and


150
00:04:06,056 --> 00:04:06,616
brought it over.


151
00:04:07,426 --> 00:04:08,566
The visual connection here is


152
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:09,566
really important because it


153
00:04:09,566 --> 00:04:10,846
tells users that they can expect


154
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:12,096
at consistent experience across


155
00:04:12,096 --> 00:04:12,556
platforms.


156
00:04:13,656 --> 00:04:15,066
And if you have a family of


157
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:16,596
apps, take a look at the iLook


158
00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:17,136
icons.


159
00:04:17,886 --> 00:04:19,986
Keynote uses the podium on both


160
00:04:19,986 --> 00:04:20,906
Mac and iOS.


161
00:04:22,016 --> 00:04:23,936
Pages uses the pen, a metaphor


162
00:04:23,936 --> 00:04:25,176
for writing and the written


163
00:04:25,176 --> 00:04:25,366
word.


164
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,576
The paper is denoted by a line


165
00:04:27,576 --> 00:04:28,816
on iOS but helps to ground the


166
00:04:28,816 --> 00:04:30,806
pen to a surface.


167
00:04:30,806 --> 00:04:32,296
Numbers uses a flat and more 2D


168
00:04:32,296 --> 00:04:34,546
representation of the chart and


169
00:04:34,546 --> 00:04:35,986
the table on iOS.


170
00:04:36,946 --> 00:04:38,226
We extend the same principles to


171
00:04:38,226 --> 00:04:40,596
GarageBand with, and iMovie with


172
00:04:40,596 --> 00:04:42,376
the guitar and the staff.


173
00:04:42,786 --> 00:04:43,896
The metaphor in color palettes


174
00:04:43,896 --> 00:04:45,006
for all of these actually share


175
00:04:45,006 --> 00:04:46,846
the cross platform to reinforce


176
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:47,616
the idea of family.


177
00:04:48,736 --> 00:04:50,056
Let's focus in on a few details.


178
00:04:50,286 --> 00:04:51,806
Some things are super important.


179
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:54,006
First off, the colors harmonize


180
00:04:54,006 --> 00:04:55,206
with the rest of iOSs vibrant


181
00:04:55,206 --> 00:04:56,806
color palette.


182
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:58,026
The glyphs are simple.


183
00:04:58,536 --> 00:04:59,996
They all share the same mass.


184
00:05:00,026 --> 00:05:01,646
They're white and high contrast.


185
00:05:01,906 --> 00:05:03,026
There are no unnecessary


186
00:05:03,026 --> 00:05:04,856
details, and they all share the


187
00:05:04,856 --> 00:05:05,596
same ground plane.


188
00:05:06,156 --> 00:05:08,026
This might just look like the


189
00:05:08,026 --> 00:05:09,516
Keynote podium, but there are


190
00:05:09,516 --> 00:05:10,626
some subtle optimizations


191
00:05:10,626 --> 00:05:11,236
within.


192
00:05:12,196 --> 00:05:13,396
For example, the corners are all


193
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,876
custom curves, so they appear


194
00:05:14,876 --> 00:05:16,336
really smooth, a large and small


195
00:05:16,336 --> 00:05:16,806
size.


196
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,236
So, again, the same principles,


197
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,446
metaphor, simplicity,


198
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:21,916
connection, lineage.


199
00:05:22,936 --> 00:05:23,606
Let's look at these as they


200
00:05:23,606 --> 00:05:24,856
relate to another app, music


201
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:26,136
memo, shown here on the right.


202
00:05:26,736 --> 00:05:27,596
There's a clear connection to


203
00:05:27,596 --> 00:05:28,946
the history of GarageBand


204
00:05:29,076 --> 00:05:30,226
through color and metaphor.


205
00:05:30,546 --> 00:05:31,686
The circle is reminiscent of a


206
00:05:31,686 --> 00:05:33,036
sound hole in an acoustic


207
00:05:33,036 --> 00:05:33,396
guitar.


208
00:05:34,216 --> 00:05:35,726
The strings vibrate in a playful


209
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:36,276
graphic way.


210
00:05:36,276 --> 00:05:37,616
There's a sense of movement and


211
00:05:37,616 --> 00:05:38,346
creativity.


212
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:40,966
The icon makes use of the iOS


213
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,526
icon grid so that when music


214
00:05:42,526 --> 00:05:43,736
memos appears next to other


215
00:05:43,736 --> 00:05:45,666
icons in the system, the common


216
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,066
elements like the circle are the


217
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:48,376
same size as say Safari.


218
00:05:48,376 --> 00:05:50,746
Now, we're going to do something


219
00:05:50,746 --> 00:05:51,776
a little fun.


220
00:05:51,776 --> 00:05:52,726
We're going to take a look at


221
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:53,916
the News app icon to look at


222
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:55,226
some of the more practical


223
00:05:55,226 --> 00:05:56,556
considerations to think of when


224
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:57,966
you design your app icon and


225
00:05:57,966 --> 00:05:59,236
some tests that you can do at


226
00:05:59,236 --> 00:06:00,366
home to make sure that your


227
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:01,526
design is holding up at a


228
00:06:01,526 --> 00:06:02,226
smaller size.


229
00:06:02,516 --> 00:06:05,646
So, let's ask ourselves a


230
00:06:05,646 --> 00:06:07,986
question, in a hypothetical


231
00:06:07,986 --> 00:06:10,676
world, what if News were the


232
00:06:10,676 --> 00:06:12,206
only app on the home screen?


233
00:06:13,436 --> 00:06:14,666
What would the icon have to


234
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,666
communicate for it to be


235
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,956
immediately clear that News does


236
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:18,076
what News actually does?


237
00:06:18,936 --> 00:06:20,256
Or to be understood without a


238
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:21,436
name underneath the icon?


239
00:06:22,456 --> 00:06:23,346
How would a good use of


240
00:06:23,346 --> 00:06:25,306
simplicity, form, color,


241
00:06:25,566 --> 00:06:27,646
contrast, composition help it to


242
00:06:27,646 --> 00:06:28,196
be understood?


243
00:06:28,466 --> 00:06:29,456
You think an icon would have to


244
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,356
work twice as hard, right?


245
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:32,606
Well, here's a few other props


246
00:06:32,606 --> 00:06:33,566
that we tried along the way.


247
00:06:34,336 --> 00:06:36,136
The first icon here has a peak


248
00:06:36,136 --> 00:06:37,766
of paper is a little abstract.


249
00:06:38,276 --> 00:06:39,116
Does the end rest on a


250
00:06:39,116 --> 00:06:40,396
newspaper, or a white box?


251
00:06:40,396 --> 00:06:41,846
A little hard to tell, and much


252
00:06:41,846 --> 00:06:43,116
of the red background is hidden.


253
00:06:43,996 --> 00:06:45,356
The second introduces another


254
00:06:45,356 --> 00:06:46,326
sheet behind the first, which


255
00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:47,836
helps to reinforce the metaphor


256
00:06:47,836 --> 00:06:49,406
a little, but when the other


257
00:06:49,406 --> 00:06:50,406
edges are missing, you can't


258
00:06:50,406 --> 00:06:51,376
tell that the N is actually


259
00:06:51,376 --> 00:06:52,776
resting on a newspaper, and the


260
00:06:52,776 --> 00:06:54,116
color is still fairly hidden.


261
00:06:55,116 --> 00:06:56,246
Let's look at the third design.


262
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:57,926
You can clearly see all the


263
00:06:57,926 --> 00:06:58,726
edges on the newspaper.


264
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:00,596
The white is high contrast; the


265
00:07:00,596 --> 00:07:01,756
red background pops.


266
00:07:02,016 --> 00:07:03,216
The rendering of the newspaper


267
00:07:03,726 --> 00:07:05,626
and logo text is simple, bold,


268
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:06,096
and graphic.


269
00:07:06,946 --> 00:07:07,456
Why does this matter?


270
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:09,966
Well, when you look at your icon


271
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:10,876
on the Home screen, you can


272
00:07:10,876 --> 00:07:11,836
really see what holds up at a


273
00:07:11,836 --> 00:07:13,396
small size and is the right mix


274
00:07:13,396 --> 00:07:15,276
for contrast form and color.


275
00:07:15,466 --> 00:07:16,276
Here's the three designs at a


276
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:16,826
small size.


277
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:19,816
And try testing your icon in a


278
00:07:19,816 --> 00:07:21,516
folder next to other icons.


279
00:07:21,786 --> 00:07:22,406
Squint your eyes.


280
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:23,926
Where's the news article?


281
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:26,096
Right there on the top left.


282
00:07:26,436 --> 00:07:28,176
And it's easy to see because of


283
00:07:28,176 --> 00:07:28,996
the simple design.


284
00:07:28,996 --> 00:07:30,176
The composition is distinct.


285
00:07:30,176 --> 00:07:31,446
It's high contrast, and the


286
00:07:31,446 --> 00:07:33,706
color is clearly visible.


287
00:07:34,066 --> 00:07:36,166
Designing an app icon is an


288
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,176
iterative process.


289
00:07:37,586 --> 00:07:38,316
So, here's some other things


290
00:07:38,316 --> 00:07:39,046
that you could think about as


291
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:40,066
you start to design yours.


292
00:07:40,976 --> 00:07:42,076
We'll start with the first,


293
00:07:42,076 --> 00:07:43,316
trying to be unique.


294
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:45,426
Now, that might sound like a


295
00:07:45,426 --> 00:07:47,086
tall order, but it's important


296
00:07:47,086 --> 00:07:48,156
to be really aware of other apps


297
00:07:48,156 --> 00:07:48,736
in your category.


298
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:50,306
Here's the three apps in the


299
00:07:50,306 --> 00:07:52,706
video space, Quick, Instagram,


300
00:07:52,856 --> 00:07:53,236
Periscope.


301
00:07:54,136 --> 00:07:55,426
Let's look at how different


302
00:07:55,426 --> 00:07:56,176
these icons are.


303
00:07:56,406 --> 00:07:57,776
Colors and shapes are bold.


304
00:07:58,336 --> 00:07:59,676
Each is distinct; it stands out


305
00:07:59,676 --> 00:08:00,236
on the Home screen.


306
00:08:01,176 --> 00:08:02,586
Instagram is also a great


307
00:08:02,586 --> 00:08:03,746
example of how an icon can


308
00:08:03,746 --> 00:08:05,296
become synonymous with a company


309
00:08:05,296 --> 00:08:06,276
the moment you see the white


310
00:08:06,276 --> 00:08:07,596
camera glyph, the purple sky,


311
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:10,976
you immediately think Instagram.


312
00:08:10,976 --> 00:08:12,246
Second, experiment.


313
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:15,476
Now, despite how beautiful a


314
00:08:15,476 --> 00:08:16,836
blank canvas is, starting here


315
00:08:16,836 --> 00:08:18,156
might be a little daunting.


316
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:20,566
So, why not try a little bit of


317
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:20,786
sketching.


318
00:08:21,146 --> 00:08:22,616
Even if you don't think you can


319
00:08:22,656 --> 00:08:24,346
raw, sometimes a pen and paper


320
00:08:24,346 --> 00:08:25,756
goes way further than a mouse,


321
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:27,356
and sketching is a great way to


322
00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:28,386
get your ideas out without


323
00:08:28,386 --> 00:08:29,496
worrying about finessing your


324
00:08:29,496 --> 00:08:30,216
icon early on.


325
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:32,326
Do some doodles; show your


326
00:08:32,356 --> 00:08:33,586
friends; get their ideas.


327
00:08:33,586 --> 00:08:35,446
This is your app icon, so your


328
00:08:35,446 --> 00:08:36,285
design has to pop.


329
00:08:36,356 --> 00:08:37,256
Have some fun with it.


330
00:08:38,515 --> 00:08:40,456
Further, and perhaps most


331
00:08:40,456 --> 00:08:42,346
important, test.


332
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:44,296
What do we mean by test?


333
00:08:45,536 --> 00:08:46,456
Well, as you develop your app


334
00:08:46,456 --> 00:08:47,526
icon, examine on the Home


335
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:49,446
screen, in a folder, and if your


336
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,546
app has settings, the settings


337
00:08:50,546 --> 00:08:50,646
app.


338
00:08:52,016 --> 00:08:53,516
And be careful if you decide to


339
00:08:53,516 --> 00:08:54,796
represent your user interface in


340
00:08:54,796 --> 00:08:55,276
your icon.


341
00:08:55,946 --> 00:08:57,316
Clear is a great example of


342
00:08:57,316 --> 00:08:59,136
doing this really, really well.


343
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:00,976
They've got a strong visual


344
00:09:00,976 --> 00:09:02,806
style with recognizable colors


345
00:09:03,016 --> 00:09:04,516
and a simple brand of pattern


346
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:06,186
that really helps to stand out


347
00:09:06,186 --> 00:09:06,996
at a small size.


348
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:08,306
Again, it's simple, colorful,


349
00:09:08,396 --> 00:09:09,346
high contrast.


350
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,636
And last but not least, have


351
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:13,236
some patience.


352
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:14,936
The answer might not come to you


353
00:09:14,936 --> 00:09:15,366
right away.


354
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:17,286
Take your time, examine your


355
00:09:17,286 --> 00:09:19,186
options, and save your work.


356
00:09:19,606 --> 00:09:21,096
Oftentimes, it's the simplest


357
00:09:21,096 --> 00:09:22,916
design or an early direction


358
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:23,806
that you abandoned that you


359
00:09:23,806 --> 00:09:24,926
actually ultimately find is the


360
00:09:24,926 --> 00:09:25,476
right choice.


361
00:09:26,026 --> 00:09:29,206
So, to summarize, when designing


362
00:09:29,206 --> 00:09:30,516
your app icon, think about


363
00:09:31,726 --> 00:09:34,046
metaphor, a clearly identifiable


364
00:09:34,046 --> 00:09:37,006
object or symbol that is simple


365
00:09:37,006 --> 00:09:38,026
and easy to understand.


366
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,176
To create an emotional


367
00:09:40,176 --> 00:09:41,516
connection with the user, be


368
00:09:41,596 --> 00:09:42,416
fun, be playful.


369
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,286
And lineage, your icon is the


370
00:09:45,286 --> 00:09:46,226
face of your app.


371
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:47,496
It's our brand.


372
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:48,556
Think of your icon as an


373
00:09:48,556 --> 00:09:49,106
investment.


374
00:09:49,846 --> 00:09:52,306
And for the process, try to make


375
00:09:52,306 --> 00:09:53,846
your icon unique so it stands


376
00:09:53,846 --> 00:09:55,256
out on the Home screen and the


377
00:09:55,256 --> 00:09:55,666
App Store.


378
00:09:56,456 --> 00:09:57,476
Experiment with different


379
00:09:57,476 --> 00:09:59,416
designs and test them.


380
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:00,876
Use the icon grid.


381
00:10:01,176 --> 00:10:02,886
Look at icons that Apple has


382
00:10:02,886 --> 00:10:04,366
designed as reference for form


383
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:04,756
and color.


384
00:10:05,326 --> 00:10:06,576
See what looks good, big and


385
00:10:06,576 --> 00:10:06,876
small.


386
00:10:07,536 --> 00:10:08,886
Put your icon in a folder to see


387
00:10:08,886 --> 00:10:09,836
how it looks at a really small


388
00:10:09,836 --> 00:10:10,316
size.


389
00:10:10,926 --> 00:10:12,436
And don't forget to optimize


390
00:10:12,436 --> 00:10:13,416
your assets for different device


391
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:13,836
sizes.


392
00:10:14,806 --> 00:10:16,426
And above all, have patience.


393
00:10:16,886 --> 00:10:18,246
Designing an app icon can seem


394
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:19,616
like a lot of work, but if you


395
00:10:19,616 --> 00:10:20,646
invest the time to do it, it can


396
00:10:20,646 --> 00:10:21,396
really, really pay off.


397
00:10:21,396 --> 00:10:21,976
Thanks for your time.
